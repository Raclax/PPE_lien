   What is a link?

   It is a connection from one web resource to another. A link has two
   ends, An anchor and direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor
   and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource
   such as an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML
   document or an element within an HTML document. You will find many
   websites or social media platforms ( Like YouTube, and Instagram )
   which link an image to a URL or a text to a URL etc.

   This basically means that by using the ‘a’ tag, you can link 1 element
   of the code to another element that may/may not be in your code.
