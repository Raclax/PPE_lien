Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]

   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source

   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.

       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.

       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.
--

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

text   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]
   Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a
   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source
   document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks.
   These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A
   program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
--

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.
--

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]
   Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a
   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source
   document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks.
   These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A
   program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
--

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

   the PC into analog format  for transmission over the analog phone
   line.  A modem in the ISP converts the analog signal back into digital
   form for input to the ISP router.  In this case, the "access network"
   is simply a point-to-point dialup link into an edge router.  The
   point-to-point link is your ordinary twisted-pair phone line. (We will
   discuss twisted pair later in this section.) Today's modem speeds allow
   dialup access at rates up to 56 Kbps.  However, due to the poor quality
   of twisted-pair line between many homes and ISPs, many users get an

   ADSL uses frequency division multiplexing, as described in the previous

   home the ISP into three non-overlapping frequency bands:

     * a high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 KHz to 1 MHz band;

   One important characteristic of the HFC is that it is a shared
   broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend
   travels downstream on every link to every home; and every packet sent
   by a home travels on the upstream channel to the headend. For this
   reason, if several users are receiving different Internet videos on the
   downstream channel, actual rate at which each user receives its video

   CDPD does not provide for any protocols above the network layer.  From
   an Internet perspective, CDPD can be viewed as extending the Internet
   dialtone (i.e., the ability to transfer IP packets) across a wireless
   link between a mobile end system and an Internet router. An excellent
   introduction to CDPD is [Waung 98].

  1.5.2 Physical Media
--

   In order to define what is meant by a "physical medium,", let us
   reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one
   end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end
   system. This poor bit gets transmitted many, many times! The source
   end-system first transmits the bit and shortly thereafter the first
   router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits
--

   But before we get into the characteristics of the various guided medium
   types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the
   physical link (copper wire, fiber optic cable, etc.) is often
   relatively minor compared with the other networking costs. In
   particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the

Data link layer, Ethernet and physical layer

Overview

   In the previous chapters, we learnt about the application layer and
   transport layer port communication, we also looked at the network layer
   and IPv4 addressing for remote delivery of packets. In this chapter we
   look at the data link layer and discuss how it prepares packets for
   transport over different types of media and physical network
   components, we will also look at some of the Ethernet concepts and
   finally look at the physical layer.

Data link layer

   The data link layer is the 2^nd layer in the OSI model. its function is
   to primarily prepare packets for transmission over the physical media.
   It also serves to control the flow of data that will traverse the
   physical media. The Data Link PDU is the Frame. The two main functions
   performed at this layer include.
     * Framing of packets received from the network layer
     * Control of how data is handled by the physical media through MAC
--
Protocols and services

   In the other layers, most of the protocols were defined by the RFCs.
   However, in the Data Link layer, the IEEE defines most of the
   protocols. We will discuss some of these protocols in chapters on
   switching.

--
   the OSI model, is responsible for transmitting the data over the
   different types of physical media that may be present.

   The frames that are received from the data link layer are converted
   into bits for transmission over the medium in this layer. Depending on
   the type of physical medium, the physical layer may represent the bits
   as either; light signals, electrical signals or waves for transmission
--
   As we have learnt earlier; by this stage in communication, the user
   data has undergone several processes; segmentation at the transport
   layer, packets in the network layer, encapsulation into frames at the
   data link layer and finally, the data is converted into one of the
   three forms that can be transmitted over the physical media;
   electrical, light signals or microwaves in the physical layer.

--
    2. Fiber
    3. Wireless

   Just like the data link layer, the standards in the data link layer are
   not defined under RFC, however, other standards do exist.

Data carrying capacity in the physical layer
--
   different layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, however, the format of the
   frame does not change.

   As we mentioned in the previous sections, the data link layer provides
   mechanisms for converting packets to frames while the physical layer
   converts frames to bits which are then transmitted over the physical
   media.
--

Summary

   In this chapter, we have looked at the data link layer and how
   communication at layer 2 occurs. We have also looked at the physical
   layer and sending of data over the physical medium as bits. We
   concluded with the Ethernet and looked at communication over a switch</text>

<text>   A glass corridor between buildings offers a myriad of possibilities: it
   can join old and new structures, protect a historical building, bring
   together luxury home interiors, or effortlessly combine contemporary
   structures. For architects, a glass link provides both a practical and
   an aesthetic solution to elevate all kinds of projects.

   Given the effects of the coronavirus, with more people now working from
--
   listed buildings and this is where knowledge of glass links, and the
   various different uses for them, is essential.

   This article examines exactly what a glass link is, the different ways
   one might be used, and the benefits that a glass link between buildings
   can bring to a project.


--
   can provide so much scope for flexibility when it comes to enhancing a
   building. For those tasked with working on an historical or listed
   building, finding a glazing solution which meets regulations can be
   difficult – but a glass link could be the answer.

   By seamlessly and elegantly combining the old with the new in design,
   glass links can highlight the beauty of original structures, while
   providing a practical walkway or space between two buildings. Not only
   do they connect structures, but they can also be used as functional
   spaces in their own right, which expands the possibilities for any

Glass links: the details


   When it comes to the product details, glass links offer a whole host of
   benefits ranging from the practical to the aesthetic.

   Visually unobtrusive, glass links are elegantly and carefully designed
   to create a seamless ‘invisible’ effect, ensuring original aesthetics
   are preserved. They are intricately designed to ensure the frame is
   fixed to the original buildings in a precise way, which allows for
   versatility and movement between two buildings. Links can be small or
   large, simple or elaborate, and can be combined with moving or opening
   elements, for additional practical applications.

   A single glazed glass link will provide a fully weather-resistant
   glazed installation (albeit one which might not be the warmest space in
   the building!), whilst double or triple glazing will allow the glass
   linkway to become an integral part of the building’s structure:
--
   floor for maximum effect.


   Minimal footings are required, as a glass link can be fully sealed with
   silicone, whilst flashing will ensure there is no water penetration.
   Structural glass beams can be incorporated for integrity, and provide a
   robust yet minimal finish (more on this in the last section). Heat
--
   weather.


What kind of project does a glass link suit?


   Whether on a listed building as part of planning permission
   considerations, or on a modern new build as a bespoke design feature,
   different elements of high-specification structural glazing can be
   uniquely integrated to create beautiful links between spaces.

   Fixing methods can vary to suit each project’s requirements, with the
   option to secure all fixings into stonework wherever possible for a
   completely frameless look.

   Perhaps the most effective use of a glass link is in connecting old or
   listed buildings to new extensions. They work so well because, in many
   cases, heritage buildings just don’t have the space, structural
   integrity, or planning flexibility required to meet contemporary
--

   Adding an extension to an existing structure can often raise
   interesting challenges, particularly if the building is fragile. A
   glass link offers both an aesthetic division, and also a physical
   buffer between the varying architectural and construction standards
   between the two, while preserving original and historical integrity.

--

   Depending on the project you are specifying for, you might be
   considering the different ways you can create a sense of connection and
   cohesion. Glass links are the ideal solution for a range of
   architectural challenges, and will provide a tangible sense of luxury
   and uniqueness.

   For projects that require new designated walkways, a glass link is a
   fantastic addition. One of our favourite Cantifix projects, aptly named
   ‘Stepping Stone House’ , involved a beautiful outbuilding built on
   stilts over a lake, connected to the main house by a frameless glass

   For a truly unique architectural glass solution, a glass bridge link is
   undisputedly special. Another of our projects, Walkers Court, is the
   world’s first and only two-storey frameless glass bridge, using our
   first curved, sliding Pureglaze door. Forming part of the redevelopment

Glass links to introduce natural light

   In today’s modern world, we’ve become hugely dependent on artificial
   light – to the detriment of our physical and psychological health, and
--
   experience the benefits of natural light, as we simply aren’t getting
   enough of it.

   A glass link incorporates health-boosting natural light into your
   designs, and creates bright and open spaces. We’ve talked extensively
   about the health benefits of natural light and having a glass link can
   help to improve your physical and psychological health, and overall
   productivity.

--
   There are two options when it comes to fitting a roof onto a glass link
   – a glass roof, or a solid roof.

   Although fitting a glass roof onto a glass link might initially sound
   like a challenge, it isn’t so very different from any other structural
   glass roof design, so the technical details remain relatively similar.
   The main difference is that the roof will need to blend seamlessly with
   the glass link structure, particularly if aesthetics are the primary
   driver for this choice of installation..

   If the glass roof for the glazed link you are specifying is made up of
   multiple panels, then you may need to plan for internal supports below
   the structural silicone joints, between each glass unit. As a general
   rule, you’ll need internal support if the joints are over 1.3m. These
--
   security, these glass beams will be created using multiple layers of
   low iron glass.

   If you’re specifying a solid roof on a glass link design, then you will
   need to work alongside the glazing supplier and the builder to create
   the structure. A solid roof might not be as aesthetic as a glass roof,
   but it can offer privacy if there are overlooking properties.
--
Glass Links: final thoughts


   Glass links are a fantastic way to seamlessly connect the old with the
   new. As a material, glass is one of the most sympathetic and versatile
   materials to bring the old and new together in both traditional and
   modern architecture; it can give prominence to traditional features
   while creating contemporary spaces.


   Whether it’s a glass link corridor, or a small and discrete glass link,
   a ‘new-to-old’ design can create an almost invisible transition between
   structures. Linking old buildings with modern designs can present a
   challenge, but here at Cantifix, we take the time necessary to design
   the most suitable and beautiful installation possible.


   If you are looking to include a glass link on a client’s project, get
   in touch with us for help and guidance on the right solution for you.
   Our specialists can assist with any specification enquiries to maximise
   your project’s potential.</text>

--
   connecting consumers with brands for business.

   Here are 6 questions and answers on the fundamentals of using a social
   media focused approach for link attraction and acquisition.

   How do you define “social linking”?

   I don’t really use that term but I suppose social linking most often
   means using social media channels to promote content that inspires
   social shares with links. A Tweet, Facebook status update or Pinterest
   pin that includes a link to the content being promoted are all examples
   of social links. Social shares with links = social links.

   It’s worth considering that social channels are also used to promote
   content to communities that include bloggers and journalists who may
   notice and link to the promoted source. Those are not social links per
   se, but they are inspired from content promoted through social
   channels.

   The advancement of social media and SEO integration has created a shift
   from seeking links purely for the potential impact on better search
   visibility to a content focused approach which emphasizes the impact
   that promoted and optimized content can have at attracting traffic
   directly. Social links achieved as a result of promoted content are
   either an equal or a secondary objective.

   How do you define the key types of social links?

   I think social links have different characteristics and so the
   definition depends on what you’re after.

   One marketer might look at links within social shares and discern value
   based on nofollow vs. those that pass PageRank because of a primary
   focus on traditional SEO.  Another marketer might evaluate links based
   on how much traffic was sent in a particular time frame, additional
   levels of shares of the link and overall propagation because of a focus
   on awareness, branding and reach.

   Other basic social link characteristics or types might include:
     * Content shared on social channels that includes a link (temporal
       and permanent)
     * Links contained within feeds (RSS, fire hose, syndicated)
     * Links contained on social profile web pages
     * Clean links that pass PageRank
     * Nofollow or crawler “un friendly” links
     * Shortened links/URLs

--
   interact with the information.  People that are empowered to publish
   through blogging, commenting or other social content sharing may decide
   to act on content they’ve been exposed to through social channels in
   the form of a link to it.

   It’s completely up to the discretion of search engines to adhere to
   nofollow, or not. Search engine policies and terms of use are not
   something we can control, so approaching direct and indirect benefits
   from links within social channels should focus on the ability to affect
   a target audience first and foremost. Doing so in a search engine
   friendly way can make that effort even more effective.

   If nofollow social links are of little SEO value now, who’s to say
   search engines won’t value them in a different way that could be come a
   SEO or Social SEO asset in the future? If the links provide value to
   the influencers and followers we’re trying to reach and they act on
   those links in a meaningful, measurable way, then the most important
   objective is achieved.

   How much of an impact do you believe social linking is having on search
   engine algorithms for non-logged in and non-personalized users?

   The links contained in the millions of social shares that happen on a
   regular basis is too rich (in my opinion) for search engines to ignore
   completely. If content resonates with a community and they actively
   share that content at an accelerated rate, I can’t imagine why a search
--
   usage.

   It’s important not to forget the ancillary impact of social shares with
   links that surface interesting content to people who decide to create
   “follow” links from their blogs, in comments or from other content
   sources that are outside of social networks. That’s an example of
   social linking that can impact search, albeit, indirectly.

   How do you view the measurement of social links, versus traditional
   links?

   Social shares with links are important for driving traffic and creating
   awareness of content. The extent that they can be a signal for generic
   search or logged in search is a value too. The authority of authors
   that share the links, the rate and quantity of social shares and the
   topics associated with source and destination are all worth considering
   when evaluating social links.

   The reason why the link is created, the context, is as important as the
   distinction of social vs. traditional. A blogger might link to another
   web page or blog within an article that contains hundreds of words.  A
   link within a Tweet might only involve a handful of words. But that
   same link could be re-tweeted hundreds of times in a very short period
   of time. It’s less likely that hundreds of bloggers would write blog
   posts including hundreds of words within a similarly short period of
   time.

   The anchor text and page/domain authority of the source are important
   values for traditional links. The annotation (since there is no anchor
   text with a social link) and rate of link duplication/propagation are
   important values for a social link. I think there’s still value to the
   cumulative number of social links but not in the same way as
   traditional page-to-page links.

   Is there an ROI on social linking, or should marketers approach the
   same as link building, in the sense that it is known to be a key
   cornerstone for achieving higher visibility?

   I would evaluate based on determining whether social linking is</text>

What is Social Links?

   Social Links is a tool developed and owned by the Department of State
   that enables Department social media practitioners and content managers
   to provide their audiences with a secure way to view promoted content.
   Social Links enhances content strategy in a similar way as other
   popular tools on the market, such as Link in Bio or Linktree. The
   Social Links URL is placed in an Instagram account bio to drive traffic
   towards calls to action, downstream web properties and valuable content
   that your Mission wants to promote.

   LAB designed the first iteration of Social Links with Missions in mind
   by tailoring features to fit the specific needs of staff in the field
   based on real user feedback. It was designed as a plugin for WordPress
   and is already installed on the Mission Website Platform administrative
   site. It can be activated on your site by request and Social Link pages
   are hosted as part of your existing Mission website.

Why Use Social Links?
--
   Third-party platforms, like LinkTree, are not FedRAMP approved, which
   focuses on the security and protection of sensitive federal information
   within cloud technologies. By creating a State Department-owned version
   of these tools, Social Links is able provide valuable benefits specific
   to the Department’s unique needs. They include:
     * Security: Using a third-party platform that is not FedRAMP approved
       poses security risks to the Department. Since Social Links is
       installed on the Mission Website Platform, it inherits the security
       standards already in place on your current website.
     * Branding: Social Links provides cohesive branding through two style
       templates that match both the legacy Mission websites as well as
       the new redesigned sites launched this year.
     * Traffic: Using a third-party platform sends valuable traffic away
       from DOS web properties but because Social Links is hosted on your
       Mission website, all initial web traffic stays within DOS
       properties. Since Google Analytics is already in use for your
       Mission website, you have access to powerful analytics for Social
       Links as well.
     * Access: Mission staff can easily access and manage Social Links
       through your Mission website administration site.

Requesting Social Links

   To request activation of a new Social Links page, please work with your
   MWP Web Manager to complete this form.

   The form will request the following information:
--
     * Mission website URL
     * Which version of MWP you’re on (2021 redesign or legacy)
     * Preferred format (grid or list)
     * Links to other social properties, like Instagram, Facebook, etc.
     * Preferred URL for your Social Links page (Example:
       https://do.usembassy.gov/embajadausaenrd/ )

     * Users that will need access to manage your Social Links page (Note:
       users that are not approved MWP users will need to complete an
       extra step requiring management approval to authorize site access;
       users must also have an america.gov account)

   Link is the main charectar Shigeru Miyamotoʼs classic series "Zelda".
   He was named link because Shiggy thought of him as the "Link" between
   the player and the game world. He is a Hylian, an elfish type charcetar
   from the land of hyrule. In most games, he is young (looks about 12,
   but he becomes an adult for Half of OOT), with golden-blond or brown
   hair, and wears a Green tunic. Except for OOT and MM, link is reborn in
   a diffrent time and storyline in every game (as is Princess Zelda)
   and prevents ganondorf, the evil wizard guy who was the only male born
   amoung the Geurdos, from stealing the triforce. The storylines do

   The Legend of Zelda series (which is poorly named, considering that
   itʼs Link that does most of the legendary stuff) features Link as its
   main character. He is world renown for dressing like a flamboyant elf,
   swinging his big thing around (his sword, I mean), and never saying
   anything, even when heʼs being stoned to death by Octoroks.

Link

   A link (short for hyperlink) is an HTML object that allows you to jump
   to a new location when you click or tap it. Links are found on almost
   every webpage and provide a simple means of navigating between pages on
   the web.

   Links can be attached to text, images, or other HTML elements. Most
   text links are blue since that is the standard color web browsers use
   to display links. However, links can be any color since the style of
   the link text may be customized using HTML or CSS styles. In the early
   days of the web, links were underlined by default. Today, underlining
   links is less common.

   When a link is applied to an image, the link tag encapsulates, or
   surrounds the image tag. Since the image tag is nested inside the link
   tag, the image itself becomes a link. This method can be used to apply
   links to other elements such as div and span objects. However,
   since CSS can be used to stylize a link, an a tag with a CSS class or
   ID attribute is often used in place of a div or span tag.

Relative and Absolute Links

   The first link above is a "relative link" because it does not include
   the domain name. Instead, the link is relative to the current website.
   Any internal link on TechTerms.com, for example, does not need
   "https://techterms.com/" in the source. Rather, a relative link like
   "/definition/computer" is all that is required. Since the link starts
   with a forward slash, the path begins with the root directory. If a
   relative link does not start with a forward slash, the path is relative
   to the current URL.

   The second link above is an absolute link because it includes the
   domain name. Absolute links are required for external links, which
   direct you to another website. They may begin with "http" or "https."
   Absolute links may also begin with two forward slashes ("//"). This is
   interpreted as "http://" for pages served via HTTP and "https://" for
   pages served via HTTPS.

12.1 Introduction to links and anchors

   HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text
   and structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup
   languages is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This
   section introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic
   hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to
   another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the
   primary forces driving the success of the Web.

   A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link
   starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor,
   which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound
   bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document,
--

  12.1.1 Visiting a linked resource

   The default behavior associated with a link is the retrieval of another
   Web resource. This behavior is commonly and implicitly obtained by
   selecting the link (e.g., by clicking, through keyboard input, etc.).

   The following HTML excerpt contains two links, one whose destination
   anchor is an HTML document named "chapter2.html" and the other whose
--
See also this A href="../images/forest.gif"map of the enchanted forest./A
/BODY

   By activating these links (by clicking with the mouse, through keyboard
   input, voice commands, etc.), users may visit these resources. Note
   that the href attribute in each source anchor specifies the address of
   the destination anchor with a URI.

   The destination anchor of a link may be an element within an HTML
   document. The destination anchor must be given an anchor name and any
   URI addressing this anchor must include the name as its fragment
   identifier.
--
   (naming with the id attribute).

   Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose
   entries link to header elements H2, H3, etc., in the same document.
   Using the A element to create destination anchors, we would write:
H1Table of Contents/H1
PA href="#section1"Introduction/ABR
--
H3 id="section2.1"On a more personal note/H3
...section 2.1...

  12.1.2 Other link relationships

   By far the most common use of a link is to retrieve another Web
   resource, as illustrated in the previous examples. However, authors may
   insert links in their documents that express other relationships
   between resources than simply "activate this link to visit that related
   resource". Links that express other types of relationships have one or
   more link types specified in their source anchor.

   The roles of a link defined by A or LINK are specified via the rel and
   rev attributes.

   For instance, links defined by the LINK element may describe the
   position of a document within a series of documents. In the following
   excerpt, links within the document entitled "Chapter 5" point to the
   previous and next chapters:
HEAD
...other head information...
--
LINK rel="next" href="chapter6.html"
/HEAD

   The link type of the first link is "prev" and that of the second is
   "next" (two of several recognized link types). Links specified by LINK
   are not rendered with the document's contents, although user agents may
   render them in other ways (e.g., as navigation tools).

   Even if they are not used for navigation, these links may be
   interpreted in interesting ways. For example, a user agent that prints
   a series of HTML documents as a single document may use this link
   information as the basis of forming a coherent linear document. Further
   information is given below on using links for the benefit of search
   engines.

  12.1.3 Specifying anchors and links

   Although several HTML elements and attributes create links to other
   resources (e.g., the IMG element, the FORM element, etc.), this chapter
   discusses links and anchors created by the LINK and A elements. The
   LINK element may only appear in the head of a document. The A element
   may only appear in the body.

   When the A element's href attribute is set, the element defines a
   source anchor for a link that may be activated by the user to retrieve
   a Web resource. The source anchor is the location of the A instance and
   the destination anchor is the Web resource.

--
   opening a new HTML document in a different window, starting a new
   program to handle the resource, etc. Since the A element has content
   (text, images, etc.), user agents may render this content in such a way
   as to indicate the presence of a link (e.g., by underlining the
   content).

   When the name or id attributes of the A element are set, the element
--
   Authors may set the name and href attributes simultaneously in the same
   A instance.

   The LINK element defines a relationship between the current document
   and another resource. Although LINK has no content, the relationships
   it defines may be rendered by some user agents.

  12.1.4 Link titles

   The title attribute may be set for both A and LINK to add information
   about the nature of a link. This information may be spoken by a user
   agent, rendered as a tool tip, cause a change in cursor image, etc.

--

  12.1.5 Internationalization and links

   Since links may point to documents encoded with different character
   encodings, the A and LINK elements support the charset attribute. This
   attribute allows authors to advise user agents about the encoding of
   data at the other end of the link.

--
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED  -- named link end --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --

  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  accesskey   %Character;    #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  shape       %Shape;        rect      -- for use with client-side image maps --
  coords      %Coords;       #IMPLIED  -- for use with client-side image maps --
--

   href = uri [CT]
          This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus
          defining a link between the current element (the source anchor)
          and the destination anchor defined by this attribute.

   hreflang = langcode [CI]
--

   type = content-type [CI]
          This attribute gives an advisory hint as to the content type of
          the content available at the link target address. It allows user
          agents to opt to use a fallback mechanism rather than fetch the
          content if they are advised that they will get content in a
          content type they do not support.
          Authors who use this attribute take responsibility to manage the
          risk that it may become inconsistent with the content available
          at the link target address.
          For the current list of registered content types, please consult
          [MIMETYPES].

   rel = link-types [CI]
          This attribute describes the relationship from the current
          document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The
          value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.

   rev = link-types [CI]
          This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the
          anchor specified by the href attribute to the current document.
          The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link
          types.
--
   Each A element defines an anchor
    1. The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
    2. The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the
       destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
    3. The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly
       one link.

--
For more information about W3C, please consult the
A href="http://www.w3.org/"W3C Web site/A.

   This link designates the home page of the World Wide Web Consortium.
   When a user activates this link in a user agent, the user agent will
   retrieve the resource, in this case, an HTML document.

   User agents generally render links in such a way as to make them
   obvious to users (underlining, reverse video, etc.). The exact
   rendering depends on the user agent. Rendering may vary according to
   whether the user has already visited the link or not. A possible visual
   rendering of the previous link might be:

   one.". Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way
   when A defines an anchor only.

   Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another
   document. URIs that designate anchors contain a "#" character followed
   by the anchor name (the fragment identifier). Here are some examples of
   such URIs:
     * An absolute URI: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one
     * A relative URI: ./one.html#anchor-one or one.html#anchor-one
     * When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one

   Thus, a link defined in the file "two.html" in the same directory as
   "one.html" would refer to the anchor as follows:
...text before the link...
For more information, please consult A href="./one.html#anchor-one" anchor one
/A.
...text after the link...

   The A element in the following example specifies a link (with href) and
   creates a named anchor (with name) simultaneously:
I just returned from vacation! Here's a
A name="anchor-two"
   href="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png"
photo of my family at the lake./A.

   This example contains a link to a different type of Web resource (a PNG
   image). Activating the link should cause the image resource to be
   retrieved from the Web (and possibly displayed if the system has been
   configured to do so).

--
   the appendix for more information about non-ASCII characters in URI
   attribute values.

  12.2.2 Nested links are illegal

   Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A
   element must not contain any other A elements.

   Since the DTD defines the LINK element to be empty, LINK elements may
   not be nested either.

  12.2.3 Anchors with the id attribute
--
       should still attempt to process it. It should alert the user and
       may allow the user to intervene and identify the document type.

12.3 Document relationships: the LINK element

!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY               -- a media-independent link --
!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
  hreflang    %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  media       %MediaDesc;    #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  

--

   This element defines a link. Unlike A, it may only appear in the HEAD
   section of a document, although it may appear any number of times.
   Although LINK has no content, it conveys relationship information that
   may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar
   with a drop-down menu of links).

   This example illustrates how several LINK definitions may appear in the
   HEAD section of a document. The current document is "Chapter2.html".
   The rel attribute specifies the relationship of the linked document
   with the current document. The values "Index", "Next", and "Prev" are
   explained in the section on link types.
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"
HTML
--
  12.3.1 Forward and reverse links

   The rel and rev attributes play complementary roles -- the rel
   attribute specifies a forward link and the rev attribute specifies a
   reverse link.

   Consider two documents A and B.
--

   Both attributes may be specified simultaneously.

  12.3.2 Links and external style sheets

   When the LINK element links an external style sheet to a document, the
   type attribute specifies the style sheet language and the media
   attribute specifies the intended rendering medium or media. User agents
   may save time by retrieving from the network only those style sheets
--

   Media types are further discussed in the section on style sheets.

  12.3.3 Links and search engines

   Authors may use the LINK element to provide a variety of information to
   search engines, including:
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, written in another human
       language.
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, designed for different
       media, for instance a version especially suited for printing.
     * Links to the starting page of a collection of documents.

   The examples below illustrate how language information, media types,
   and link types may be combined to improve document handling by search
   engines.

   In the following example, we use the hreflang attribute to tell search
   engines where to find Dutch, Portuguese, and Arabic versions of a
   document. Note the use of the charset attribute for the Arabic manual.
   Note also the use of the lang attribute to indicate that the value of
   the title attribute for the LINK element designating the French manual
   is in French.
HEAD
TITLEThe manual in English/TITLE
--
   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * target (target frame information)

   In HTML, links and references to external images, applets,
   form-processing programs, style sheets, etc. are always specified by a
   URI. Relative URIs are resolved according to a base URI, which may come
   from a variety of sources. The BASE element allows authors to specify a
--
   the definitions of these elements for more information about URI issues
   specific to them.

   Note. For versions of HTTP that define a Link header, user agents
   should handle these headers exactly as LINK elements in the document.
   HTTP 1.1 as defined by [RFC2616] does not include a Link header field
   (refer to section 19.6.3).

What is deep linking?

   Deep links are a type of link that send users directly to an app
   instead of a website or a store. They are used to send users straight
   to specific in-app locations, saving users the time and energy locating
   a particular page themselves – significantly improving the user
--

   Deep linking does this by specifying a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal
   Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens your app if
   it’s already installed. Deep links can also be set to direct users to
   specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may
   want to run.

Why are deep links important?

   Deep links produce a seamless user journey that reduces churn and
   increases the likelihood of an install. They let you make sophisticated
   campaigns while providing a better user experience, moving users onto
   your app in a single click.

   Deep links also create the opportunity for easier incentivization. It’s
   simple to persuade people to try a new experience when a potential
   prize or offer is sent to them via a retargeting campaign. For example,
   let’s say you have a music app and want to promote a new album, so you
   allocate budget to be spent on a popular website. However, you want the
   user to listen to the sample in-app, not just on the website (where
   they are only exposed to the album cover). Here you need a deep link to
   send them directly to the correct page in your app, offering a seamless
   user experience.

--

What are deferred deep links?

   Deep links are a smart way to drive conversions while offering a
   positive user experience, but what happens if the user is deep linked
   into an app they don’t have installed? This is when deferred deep links
   come in to play.

   If a user clicks on a deep link and doesn’t have the app installed,
   they can be deferred to the App Store instead. The genius of deferred
   deep linking is that when that user installs and opens up the app, they
   can still be sent to the in-app location where you initially wanted

   What is a link?

   It is a connection from one web resource to another. A link has two
   ends, An anchor and direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor
   and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource
   such as an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML
   document or an element within an HTML document. You will find many
   websites or social media platforms ( Like YouTube, and Instagram )
   which link an image to a URL or a text to a URL etc.

   This basically means that by using the ‘a’ tag, you can link 1 element
   of the code to another element that may/may not be in your code.

   HTML Link Syntax

   Links are specified in HTML using the “a” tag.

   [Screen-Shot-2017-12-08-at-12.17.21-AM.png]

   Syntax Explanation:
href : The href attribute is used to specify the destination address
       of the link used. "href" stands for Hypertext reference.
Text link : The text link is the visible part of the link.
            It is what the viewer clicks on.

   Changing Link Colours in HTML

   Different types of links appear in different formats such as:
    1. An unvisited link appears underlined and blue in colour by default.
    2. A visited link appears underlined and purple in colour by default.
    3. An active link appears underlined and red in colour by default.

   The appearance of links can be changed by using CSS.

   (December 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)

   In computer science, link time refers to the period of time, during the
   creation of a computer program, in which a linker is being applied to
   that program.^[1]^[2]^[3] Link time occurs after compile time and
   before runtime (when a program is executed).

   It is common to speak of link time operations (the operations performed
   by a linker) or link time requirements (programming language
   requirements that must be met by compiled source code for it to be
   successfully linked).

Link time operations[edit]

   The operations performed at link time usually include fixing up the
   addresses of externally referenced objects and functions, various kinds
   of cross module checks (e.g. type checks on externally visible
   identifiers and in some languages instantiation of templates). Some
   optimizing compilers delay code generation until link time because it
   is here that information about a complete program is available to them.
   Resolving external variables in a program is also done at link time.

   The link-time optimization (LTO), when enabled, occurs at link time.

Link time requirements[edit]

   The definition of a programming language may specify link time
   requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled
   (e.g. the maximum number of characters in an externally visible
   identifier that must be considered significant).</text>

   Link time may refer to any of the following:

   1. With programming, link time is the time it takes a linker to create
   an executable program from compiled modules like programs, routines, or
   libraries.

   2. When describing a software or hardware connection, link time is the
   length of time it takes a program or device to establish a connection
   or sync.</text>

   What is a Hyperlink? HTML Links Explained with Examples

   Let's begin with a quick question: How did you land on this article and
   this site today?
--
   how powerful this element is – it will get you to any part of the
   Internet just by clicking on a link.

   So, what are links and hyperlinks in HTML?

What are Links and Hyperlinks in HTML?

   A link is a chain that connects pages both within a website and to
   other websites. Without links, we wouldn't have any websites.

   For example, let's have a look at this URL,
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/. When you type it in the address bar it
   will take you to the official freeCodeCamp site.

   In simpler terms we can say that links are just the web addresses of
   web page that allow you to connect with different servers.

   Perhaps you are wondering, then, what a Hyperlink might be? Well, they
   are what allows us to link documents to other documents or resources
   via refrences called anchor tags. They are a fundamental concept behind
   the World Wide Web which makes navigation between web pages easier via
   links.
--
   For example, if you were to click HERE, you will land in my profile
   with a list of my other articles. That's a hyperlink.

How to Create Links in HTML

How to use a links

   You can create a basic link by wrapping the text (or any other related
   content) in the a/a element and using the href attribute which
   contains the address.

--

How to style links

   There are usually links inserted in the .html file that link the main
   to the styling and funtionality file. And they're typically named with
   the .css and .js file extensions.

   Here's how to link to a CSS file:
!DOCTYPE html
html
head
--
/body
/html

   And here's how to link to a JS file. You can either place what you want
   linked in the head or body tag.
!DOCTYPE html
html
--
/body
/html

How to Link Within a Site

Links to different page within a Site

   You use this type of link to direct a user to different pages on the
   same site.

   Take a case where your site has 5 pages. You'll want a user to be able
   to access all the pages from one point, like the navbar.

   First you will have to create all the pages and then link them. In this
   case we will do it like this:
nav
    ul
--
    /ul
/nav

   The above example will link to different parts of the site – the 'Home'
   page, 'Services', 'Pricing', and 'About', in that order. Writing only
   the name of the file is enough because all the work is shared in the
   same work folder.

How to Link to a specific section of a site

   Let's say that, somewhere on your site, you mentioned a particular
   topic or page. And you would like your readers or visitors to jump
--
   page. Maybe it is a paragraph – if so, this is how it would look:
p id="detailed-info" Read more on Upcoming Events /p

   After this in your link add the id in the href:
a href="#detailed-info" Read more about upcoming events /a

   This code will take them right to the Upcoming Events section.

Other Types of Links in HTML

How to Link to a Downloadable file

   When you want to link to a resource that a user needs to download
   rather than open in the browser, you can use the download attribute.
   This provides a default save filename.

How to Add E-mail Links

   Email Links allow us to create hyperlinks to an email address. You can
   create these links using the HTML a/a tag – but in this case,
   instead of passing a URL, we pass the recipient’s email address.

   You use the mailto attribute to specify the email address in your

HTML Link Attributes

   HTML links have various attributes that you can use to provide more
   speicifc information. Here are some of the most commonly used.
    1. href attribute
       The href attribute defines the target URL address for an HTML link.
       It makes the marked word or phrase clickable. The href attribute
       creates a hyperlink to another web page, and HTML links would not
       work as intended without it.
    2. target attribute
       The target attribute defines where the HTML link will be opened.
       Ever visited a website and when you click on a link it
       automatically opens in a new tab? Well that's the work of this
       attribute.

   Here are all the possible options you can use with the target
   attribute:

What is the difference between a physical link and a symbolic link?

   Julioarenas

   Share

   If you’re here is because you want to understand how links work, but
   before we understand it we must know how certain things work because it
   is an environment variable and how it differs from the other type of
   variables, also how the PAHT variable works, which has to do with the
   links in a script and that means the ASCII text within the text and how
   we make bash read it, well, actually there are many things.

   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:
--
   also environment variables, and because of this PAHT is the most
   important environment variable, if we change a small portion of the
   command path it stops working, PAHT saves the paths of “pwd , ls, mkdir
   “and many more, in other words, PHAT saves the LINKS of these commands
   inside an executable file.

   RELATIVE ROUTE:
--
   A script in LINUX is a file that contains different commands that are
   interpreted by the shell to execute them by means of its path or rather
   its LINK. The shell executes them as if it had written them in PROMPT.
   When we write a SCRIPT in a file we do it through a LINK called SHEBANG
   which gives the BASH path to read the script.

   ASCII:
--
   that is, it replaces letters with numbers which are interpreted by
   machines in a bit manner.

   I mention all this as a basis for understanding the links and their
   logical relationship of its operation, so let’s talk about links.

TO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO!
--
   PAHT others to communicate or read directly as SHEBANG that places BASH
   to read the file.

   In Linux a link can be physical or symbolic:

   PHYSICAL LINK
   Physical links can only be created for files and not for directories,
   the PHYSICAL LINK is the name given to a file in another location which
   contains the path or information that is put to it.
   example:

   create a link from the current location;

   PROMPT ~$: home/ holbertonschool-low_level_programming

   WE CREATE A FILE ~$: emacs bettyCool

   WE CREATE THE LINK ~$: ln bettyCool holberton

   We put “ls” to see the content~$: ls; holberton

   There are two files, this means that if I enter holberton it will show
   me what has bettyCool, since both have the same content. And a
   characteristic of the PHYSICAL LINKS is that if you delete one of the
   two the other still exists without any problem.

   SYMBOLIC LINKS

   The symbolic links have the same function as a physical but the
   difference is that it does not contain the data of the file, instead it
   points to that folder or to the registry where the data is located. In
   other words it is like a shortcut in Windows that when I click it takes
   me to where the content I need, it would be like a kind of hyperlink of
   a web page. If the destination file is deleted the symbolic link will
   be unusable, because it will not be able to refer to the file it was
   pointing to, since it is not there.

   Symbolic links have the same syntax as the physical one but with a
   small only that we add the option -s to indicate that we want to make a
   symbolic link.
   Example:
--
   PROMPT ~$ : ls/home/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/

   we have files ~$: bettyCool
   We create the symbolic link from the current path and we create a new
   home file called ENIAC that points to the bettyCool path.

   Now we see that after creating the symbolic link we go to the home
   folder and with “ls -l” we will see that ENIAC points to the ROUTE of
   bettyCool, and if we enter ENIAC it shows me the content of bettyCool,
   this would be the same and practically a C pointer.

When you open files or directories very repeatedly, links are your best tool
to shorten time and eliminate headaches,
use them as you will look very professional in doing so.
Thank you and I hope this information helps you with Linux.</text>

Hard links and soft links in Linux explained

   Let's discuss when you should use hard links or soft links, and the
   syntax of the ln command.

   most people. This is a frustrating feeling, but it is also one that
   often is easily remedied. Sometimes, it only takes someone explaining
   the concept in "plain English," aka layman's terms. That is the goal of
   this article. I want to talk about hard links and soft (symbolic) links
   in the most basic terms possible. You may realize that this concept,
   which is often a struggle for sysadmins, is quite simple. If nothing
   else, I take you through the syntax to create these links (which many
   people find difficult to remember). So let's get down to it.

Hard links

   The concept of a hard link is the most basic we will discuss today.
   Every file on the Linux filesystem starts with a single hard link. The
   link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the
   filesystem. Creating an additional hard link to a file means a few
   different things. Let's discuss these.

   First, you create a new filename pointing to the exact same data as the
   old filename. This means that the two filenames, though different,
   point to identical data. For example, if I create file
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/link_test and write hello world in the file, I
   have a single hard link between the file name link_test and the file
   content hello world.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test

   Take note of the link count here (1).

   Next, I create a new hard link in /tmp to the exact same file using the
   following command:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln link_test /tmp/link_new

--
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 /tmp/link_new

   The primary difference here is the filename. The link count has also
   been changed (2). Most notably, if I cat the new file's contents, it
   displays the original data.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ cat /tmp/link_new
hello world

   When changes are made to one filename, the other reflects those
   changes. The permissions, link count, ownership, timestamps, and file
   content are the exact same. If the original file is deleted, the data
   still exists under the secondary hard link. The data is only removed
   from your drive when all links to the data have been removed. If you
   find two files with identical properties but are unsure if they are
   hard-linked, use the ls -i command to view the inode number. Files that
   are hard-linked together share the same inode number.
--

Hard limits

   While useful, there are some limitations to what hard links can do. For
   starters, they can only be created for regular files (not directories
   or special files). Also, a hard link cannot span multiple filesystems.
   They only work when the new hard link exists on the same filesystem as
   the original.

Soft links

   Commonly referred to as symbolic links, soft links link together
   non-regular and regular files. They can also span multiple filesystems.
   By definition, a soft link is not a standard file, but a special file
   that points to an existing file. Let's look at how to create a soft
   link. I use the ln -s command and the following syntax:

--

   In the example below, I create a new file at
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test with the file content soft Hello
   world. I then create a soft link to that file at /tmp/soft_link_new:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln -s /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test /tmp/soft_lin
k_new
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l soft_link_test /tmp/soft_link_new
--

   All of this sounds great, but there are some drawbacks to using a soft
   link. The biggest concern is data loss and data confusion. If the
   original file is deleted, the soft link is broken. This situation is
   referred to as a dangling soft link. If you were to create a new file
   with the same name as the original, your dangling soft link is no
   longer dangling at all. It points to the new file created, whether this
   was your intention or not, so be sure to keep this in mind.

Hard or soft?

   There is no clear answer here. The best link is the type that fits your
   particular situation. While these concepts can be tricky to remember,
   the syntax is pretty straightforward, so that is a plus! To keep the
   two easily separated in your mind, I leave you with this:
     * A hard link always points a filename to data on a storage device.
     * A soft link always points a filename to another filename, which
       then points to information on a storage device.

   Hopefully, this helps you keep them separated as you work your way
   through the link types needed to accomplish your daily goals!

What are link aggregation and LACP and how can I use them in my network?

   Was this article helpful?   Yes     No | 11 people found this helpful
   in last 30 days

What is link aggregation?

   Link aggregation allows you to combine multiple Ethernet links into a
   single logical link between two networked devices.

   Link aggregation is sometimes called by other names:
     * Ethernet bonding
     * Ethernet teaming
     * Link bonding
     * Link bundling
     * Link teaming
     * Network interface controller (NIC) bonding
     * NIC teaming
     * Port aggregation
--
   another switch, a server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, or a
   multi-port access point.

   Network devices and management functions treat the link aggregation
   group (LAG) of multiple Ethernet connections as a single link. For
   example, you can include a LAG in a virtual local area network (VLAN).
   You can also configure more than one LAG on the same switch, or add
   more than two Ethernet links to the same LAG (the maximum number of
   links per LAG depends on your device).

   Some network devices support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),
   which helps to prevent errors in the link aggregation setup process.

   Unmanaged switches do not support link aggregation.


What are the benefits of link aggregation?

   Link aggregation offers the following benefits:
     * Increased reliability and availability. If one of the physical
       links in the LAG goes down, traffic is dynamically and
       transparently reassigned to one of the other physical links.
     * Better use of physical resources. Traffic can be load-balanced
       across the physical links.
     * Increased bandwidth. The aggregated physical links deliver higher
       bandwidth than each individual link.
     * Cost effectiveness. A physical network upgrade can be expensive,
       especially if it requires new cable runs. Link aggregation
       increases bandwidth without requiring new equipment.


What are the different types of LAGs?

   The two primary types of LAGs are static (also known as manual) and
   dynamic. Dynamic LAGs use Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to
   negotiate settings between the two connected devices.

   Some devices support static LAGs, but do not support dynamic LAGs with
--
   supports LACP.

   Linux-based devices, such as NETGEAR ReadyNAS storage devices, often
   offer several additional types of link aggregation that provide
   increased fault tolerance or load balancing instead of increased
   bandwidth.


What is Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)?

   Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE standard defined in IEEE
   802.3ad. LACP lets devices send Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data
   Units (LACPDUs) to each other to establish a link aggregation
   connection. You still need to configure the LAG on each device, but
   LACP helps prevent one of the most common problems that can occur
   during the process of setting up link aggregation: misconfigured LAG
   settings. If the devices detect that they cannot establish a link
   aggregation connection, they do not try to establish it, and the link
   shows as “down” in the admin interface.

   Another useful feature of LACP is that when one member link stops
   sending LACPDUs (if the cable is unplugged, for example), it is removed
   from the LAG. This helps to minimize packet loss.

--
   both devices support LACP.


How do I set up link aggregation in my network?

   The following instructions describe in general terms how to set up link
   aggregation between two devices in your network. For more information
   about setting up link aggregation on specific NETGEAR devices, see the
   NETGEAR product support page for your product. To find your product’s
   support page, visit https://www.netgear.com/support/ and enter your
   product model number in the search box.

   To set up link aggregation between two devices in your network:
    1. Make sure that both devices support link aggregation.
    2. Configure the LAG on each of the two devices.
    3. Make sure that the LAG that you create on each device has the same
       settings for port speed, duplex mode, flow control, and MTU size
--
       the LAG on each device.
    7. Verify that the port LED for each connected port on each NETGEAR
       switch is blinking green.
    8. Verify in the admin interface for each device that the link is UP.

   Everything You Need To Know About App Links

   Mobile App Links are a type of mobile URLs. They make it possible to
   link to specific pages or screens of an app. They also allow you to
   link your website pages to the respective screens in your app.

What do App Links do?


    They close the loop between the creation of content, its discovery
    and app downloads by creating unique links for different pages or
    screens of an app. Thus, App Links allow users to click links to view
    content directly in the app (if already downloaded), or download the
    app to view content present on any particular screen of the app.

--

   Nopes, you can only share the mobile App URLs with others. Since there
   is no such thing as an address bar for apps, it is not possible to type
   App Links in the address bar.

What theory is App Links based on?

   App Links is based on the principle of ‘Deep-linking‘, which involve
   linking to specific screens (pages) within apps and launching mobile
   apps via links.

Which platforms do App Links support?

   App url deeplinks is cross platform

   App Links are cross-platform and currently support iOS, Android and
   Windows Phones. However, they can also be extended to support other
   platforms.

Are App Links free?

   App Links are open source, so you can use them without paying for it.
   You can also change them to suit any platform or environment.

How do they work?

   They let you link from an app to specific screens within the same or a
   different app. In short, they work like URLs for websites.

   How App Links work

Example 1 – Linking to a screen in the same app

   If I have opened a Facebook page on my Facebook app, and if I want to
   share a link of that page (without visiting the Facebook website) from
   the app with my friend, then I will use its URL (App Link) and share it
   with my friend using the messages or chat window.

Linking Pinterest app from inside of a Facebook app

   Provided that some conditions are satisfied, you can link to a tweet in
   Twitter app from your Facebook app using App Links . The requirements
   are that both Facebook and Twitter need to have App Links enabled. Now,
   Facebook app has built-in App Links functionality, but Twitter has a
   different set of deeplinks as part of its feature called Twitter Cards.
   Since, not both the apps have App Links, it is not possible to link
   them.

   However, you can link an app like Pinterest (which supports App Links)
   with Facebook app. All you have to do is to go to a screen in
   Pinterest, copy the App Link (or URI), then open your Facebook app and
   paste it in your status update. Your friends who click on the link on a
   desktop will be shown download links for Pinterest app for platforms
   like iOS, Android or Windows Phone; however, they won’t being able to
   download the Pinterest app on their laptop. The friends who click on
   the link through a mobile device, will be directed to the image URL
   (regardless of the mobile platform) if they have the Pinterest app
   installed; if they don’t have the Pinterest app, they will be directed
   to the download link for that particular platform, clicking on which
   would take them to the image URL.

What is the minimum requirement for App Links to work?

   For App Links to work, the linking and the linked apps should have App
   Links enabled.

How to enable App Links for an app?

   App Links can be enabled for an app by defining customized Universal
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) for that app and adding specific tags in
   the codes of that app.

What are the different types of App links in the market?

   App Links is a name of a certain type of deeplinks which have been
   instituted by AppLinks.org. Some other companies have also developed
   links for apps, with a different set of features compared to App Links.
   They are as follows:

Cellogic Ltd’s Deeplink

   The Deeplink.me services help in making your app pages linkable through
   deeplinks,  just like App Links. The links build using deeplink.me
   function for app pages of an app on all platforms. They also offer
   translation rules for customized URIs, user engagement analytics, link
   fallbacks in the case of an emergency/failure and Twitter Card (see
--
Tapstream’s Deferred Links


    Links to a specific screen or a landing within an app through URIs,
    text ads or image ads. Clicking on the link or the ad takes users to
    the destination screen within the app. It does this in two ways

    1. If the user has the destination app installed, it directly takes
--
       as the app is getting installed it displays a message indicating
       that the user will be directed to the landing page.

   Onboarding Links by Tapstream

Users are directed to a particular screen on downloading an app for the first
time

   Tapstream’s Deferred Links are mainly for app marketing companies who
   intend to make use of Landing Pages within their apps to generate
   quality leads. The Deferred Links are paid, and have different price
   points.

Twitter’s App Cards

   Twitter’s App Cards
   One of the several different Twitter Cards, through App Cards you can
   tweet a link to any webpage on your website and Twitter will
   automatically display your tweet alongside an App Card. This App Card
   would show all the data regarding your app like screenshot, ratings,
   free or paid app, description and a link to its App Store depending on
   the mobile platform you prefer. For this to work, you should have the
   App Card enabled in your website and have specified your card type and
   app IDs for iOS and Android. Twitter App Card with detailed app
   information

Twitter App Card showing automatically embedded information about an app
whose download link was tweeted

   This App Card can also show links to specific pages within the app for
   the website, provided the app has deeplinking enabled.
   URX’s Omnilinks, Omnilinks.js and App Search
   Enabling Omnilinks and deeplink Analytics for an app
--
Analytics

   URX has developed two separate approaches for deeplinking within apps.
   Omnilinks helps users to link to specifc pages within the same or a
   different app. This approach is especially useful if a user doesn’t
   have an app installed, in which case the user is directed to the
   download link for the app on the platform-specific app store. And, if
   the user already has an app installed, he is directly taken to the
   specific screen within the app. This facility is extremely useful to
   marketers who intend to increase their app downloads by directing
--
   required. You just need to add ‘http://urx.io/’ before your URI to
   create omnilink.
   Requirement: For Omnilinks to work, an app must have deeplinks, without
   which the URX Omnilinks are to link between apps. Similarly, websites
   must have appropriate meta tags enabled to make it possible to link
   them to an app. URX’s Omnilinks support App Links tags, so if you App
   Links tags enabled, you just have to prepend the URX code to the URI.
   App Search: This feature allows apps to scour the content present on
   other apps and also link to the respective pages of that app.

Are all these different types of App Links (i.e deep links) cross-compatible?

   Unfortunately, only some of these compatible with each other (App Links
   and URX’s Omnilinks). The reason for that is, all the services are

Which companies have adopted AppLinks?

   Facebook, a partner in the AppLinks initiative, has implemented them
   across most of its features. App Links currently supports News Feed,
   pages, status updates and links shared by apps. Top mobile apps like
   Mailbox, Quip, and Spotify also have deeply integrated AppLinks.
   Some major companies have recently made their content available for
   linking. They are: Pinterest, Redfin, Goodreads, Edomondo, Hulu,
--
   Tumblr, EyeEm, Houzz, Flickr, Vevo, Vimeo, Rhapsody, Fancy.com, iHeart,
   Songkick, and DailyMotion.

Why are App Links a good investment of your time and resources?

   App Links are slightly complicated, and might take some time to
   implement and a little more to perfect, but they give you so many other
   things in return.
   First of all, they help you drive your app downloads, regardless of the
   platform, if visitors happen to stumble across the app download link.
   This will, in turn, also lead to an increase in paid app or ad revenue
   from your mobile app.
   f the familiarity and convenience that App Links provide. This also
   increase the visibility of your app, which unlike your website, stays
   hidden from the eyes of people most of the times.
   Most importantly, since not many companies have implemented App Links,
   they will also lend your app or website a novel factor. So, people will
   keep coming back or download the app just to experience something new.

How do I start implementing App Links from scratch?

   If you are implementing App Links for the first time, then use Facebook
   SDK to deeplink your mobile app. Facebook has provided comprehensive
   documentation along with how-tos (with screenshots) on how to implement
   App Links as well as all the special features. Also, using Facebook SDK
   would help you leverage your website’s social media presence to
   increase downloads of your app and thus generate revenue.

What are some new or additional features of App Links?

   Analytics
   App Links have inbuilt functionality to measure and analyse how they
   are being used with apps. They can track the clicks, the landing pages,
   time, date, frequency and other data to give you a comprehensive lists
   and graphs of analytics. Using these analytics, you can optimize the
   integration of App Links into your app to enrich the experience of
   users or generate revenue from your app. To set up Analytics for App
   Links you have include lines of code on Bolts SDK, which is found in
   Facebook SDK. Since there is no SDK to support Bolts SDK except that of
   Facebook, this functionality is difficult to implement with other
   services.

Issues, Problems, Worries and Difficulties:

     * The cross-platform compatibility of App Links also makes it a bit
       more complicated. There are three major mobile platforms (iOS,
       Android and Windows Phone) in the mobile app market. If you have
       the same app available on different platforms, you have to define
--
       an app, as app use much less real and are extremely simplistic in
       nature.
     * Linking to a screen from one app to a different app can also be
       really disruptive. For example, if I link from Facebook app to The
       Huffington Post and I used my Twitter account to log in to The
       Huffington Post, then I will be taken to the Twitter app first to
       login, after which I will redirected to The Huffington Post app. It
       is also possible that I might be directed to the download link for
       Twitter app even though it is already installed on my smartphone.
     * Most of the services listed here (excluding App Links) are not
       available to Windows Phone apps. So, there is still no way for App
       Links to deeplink to your Windows Phone app.

   PS: I have used ‘screen’ and ‘page’ interchangeably for an app. Both
   mean the same, a screen or a page within an app. Also, I have used App
   Links instead of the oft-used generic term for mobile app links i.e
   ‘deeplinks’ to make understanding this new concept simpler.

   In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a
   hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed,
   piece of web content on a website (e.g.
   "https://example.com/path/page"), rather than the website's home page

   The technology behind the World Wide Web, the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP), does not actually make any distinction between "deep"
   links and any other links—all links are functionally equal. This is
   intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors
   to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of
   so-called "deep" linking is therefore built into the Web technology of
   HTTP and URLs by default—while a site can attempt to restrict deep
   links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the World Wide Web

Usage[edit]

   Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into
   their content either because it bypasses advertising on their main
   pages, passes off their content as that of the linker or, like The Wall
   Street Journal, they charge users for permanently valid links.

The Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Violence Toward Humans

   People who hurt animals don’t stop with animals. There is an
   established link between cruelty to animals and violence toward
   humans — regularly referred to as “The Link.”

   This link makes it critically important that cruelty toward animals be
   taken seriously by law enforcement, and by society at large. This is
   for the sake of the animals themselves, and for people who are also at
   risk.

Research Shows the Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Toward Humans

   Ample research backs up the finding that there is a direct link between
   acts of cruelty to animals and violence toward humans. This includes
   child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse and other violent behavior.

--
   of Cruelty to Animals and Northeastern University found that animal
   abusers are in fact five times as likely to also harm other humans.

   school massacres also committed acts of cruelty to animals — generally
   against cats and dogs.

   Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition — a group
   focusing on the intersection between violence toward animals and humans
   — has written often about animal abuse being an indication of domestic
   violence, or what’s called a “predictor crime.”

The Law Must Protect Animals and Punish Animal Abusers

   Both because animals themselves need protection, and because of the
   link between cruelty to animals and cruelty to humans, violence against
   animals must be taken seriously under the law.

   There are some ways in which the law is reflecting this seriousness.</text>

   The meaning of link as "connect or join up" does not require an object.

   The meaning of relate as "show a connection between" can take an

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \

Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.

text   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]
   Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a
   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source
   document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks.
   These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A
   program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
--

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

text   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World

   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.

       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.

   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

text   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
--

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.
--

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

   line.  A modem in the ISP converts the analog signal back into digital
   form for input to the ISP router.  In this case, the "access network"
   is simply a point-to-point dialup link into an edge router.  The
   point-to-point link is your ordinary twisted-pair phone line. (We will
   discuss twisted pair later in this section.) Today's modem speeds allow
   dialup access at rates up to 56 Kbps.  However, due to the poor quality

   ADSL uses frequency division multiplexing, as described in the previous
   section. In particular, ADSL divides the communication link between the
   home the ISP into three non-overlapping frequency bands:

   One important characteristic of the HFC is that it is a shared
   broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend
   travels downstream on every link to every home; and every packet sent

   reason, if several users are receiving different Internet videos on the

   CDPD does not provide for any protocols above the network layer.  From
   an Internet perspective, CDPD can be viewed as extending the Internet
   dialtone (i.e., the ability to transfer IP packets) across a wireless
   link between a mobile end system and an Internet router. An excellent
   introduction to CDPD is [Waung 98].

  1.5.2 Physical Media
--

   In order to define what is meant by a "physical medium,", let us
   reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one
   end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end
   system. This poor bit gets transmitted many, many times! The source
   end-system first transmits the bit and shortly thereafter the first
   router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits

   But before we get into the characteristics of the various guided medium
   types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the
   physical link (copper wire, fiber optic cable, etc.) is often
   relatively minor compared with the other networking costs. In
   particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the
   physical link can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the
   material. For this reason, many builders install twisted pair, optical
   fiber, and coaxial cable to every room in a building. Even if only one
   medium is initially used, there is a good chance that another medium

   and discussion of the technology and products.

   A communication satellite links two or more earth-based microwave
   transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives
   transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a
   repeater (discussed below), and transmits the signal on another

   orbit at 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This huge
   distance between from ground station though satellite back to ground
   station introduces a substantial signal propagation delay of 250
   milliseconds. Nevertheless, satellites links are often used in
   telephone networks and in the backbone of the Internet.

Data link layer, Ethernet and physical layer

Overview

   In the previous chapters, we learnt about the application layer and
   transport layer port communication, we also looked at the network layer
   and IPv4 addressing for remote delivery of packets. In this chapter we
   look at the data link layer and discuss how it prepares packets for
   transport over different types of media and physical network
   components, we will also look at some of the Ethernet concepts and
   finally look at the physical layer.

Data link layer

   The data link layer is the 2^nd layer in the OSI model. its function is
   to primarily prepare packets for transmission over the physical media.
   It also serves to control the flow of data that will traverse the
   physical media. The Data Link PDU is the Frame. The two main functions
   performed at this layer include.
     * Framing of packets received from the network layer
     * Control of how data is handled by the physical media through MAC
--
Protocols and services

   In the other layers, most of the protocols were defined by the RFCs.
   However, in the Data Link layer, the IEEE defines most of the
   protocols. We will discuss some of these protocols in chapters on
   switching.

--
   the OSI model, is responsible for transmitting the data over the
   different types of physical media that may be present.

   The frames that are received from the data link layer are converted
   into bits for transmission over the medium in this layer. Depending on
   the type of physical medium, the physical layer may represent the bits
   as either; light signals, electrical signals or waves for transmission
--
   As we have learnt earlier; by this stage in communication, the user
   data has undergone several processes; segmentation at the transport
   layer, packets in the network layer, encapsulation into frames at the
   data link layer and finally, the data is converted into one of the
   three forms that can be transmitted over the physical media;
   electrical, light signals or microwaves in the physical layer.

--
    2. Fiber
    3. Wireless

   Just like the data link layer, the standards in the data link layer are
   not defined under RFC, however, other standards do exist.

Data carrying capacity in the physical layer
--
   different layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, however, the format of the
   frame does not change.

   As we mentioned in the previous sections, the data link layer provides
   mechanisms for converting packets to frames while the physical layer
   converts frames to bits which are then transmitted over the physical
   media.
--

Summary

   In this chapter, we have looked at the data link layer and how
   communication at layer 2 occurs. We have also looked at the physical
   layer and sending of data over the physical medium as bits. We
   concluded with the Ethernet and looked at communication over a switch/text

text   A glass corridor between buildings offers a myriad of possibilities: it
   can join old and new structures, protect a historical building, bring
   together luxury home interiors, or effortlessly combine contemporary
   structures. For architects, a glass link provides both a practical and
   an aesthetic solution to elevate all kinds of projects.

   Given the effects of the coronavirus, with more people now working from
--
   listed buildings and this is where knowledge of glass links, and the
   various different uses for them, is essential.

   This article examines exactly what a glass link is, the different ways
   one might be used, and the benefits that a glass link between buildings
   can bring to a project.


--
   can provide so much scope for flexibility when it comes to enhancing a
   building. For those tasked with working on an historical or listed
   building, finding a glazing solution which meets regulations can be
   difficult – but a glass link could be the answer.

   By seamlessly and elegantly combining the old with the new in design,
   glass links can highlight the beauty of original structures, while
   providing a practical walkway or space between two buildings. Not only
   do they connect structures, but they can also be used as functional
   spaces in their own right, which expands the possibilities for any

Glass links: the details


   When it comes to the product details, glass links offer a whole host of
   benefits ranging from the practical to the aesthetic.

   Visually unobtrusive, glass links are elegantly and carefully designed
   to create a seamless ‘invisible’ effect, ensuring original aesthetics
   are preserved. They are intricately designed to ensure the frame is
   fixed to the original buildings in a precise way, which allows for
   versatility and movement between two buildings. Links can be small or
   large, simple or elaborate, and can be combined with moving or opening
   elements, for additional practical applications.

   A single glazed glass link will provide a fully weather-resistant
   glazed installation (albeit one which might not be the warmest space in
   the building!), whilst double or triple glazing will allow the glass
   linkway to become an integral part of the building’s structure:
--
   floor for maximum effect.


   Minimal footings are required, as a glass link can be fully sealed with
   silicone, whilst flashing will ensure there is no water penetration.
   Structural glass beams can be incorporated for integrity, and provide a
   robust yet minimal finish (more on this in the last section). Heat

   weather.


What kind of project does a glass link suit?


   Whether on a listed building as part of planning permission
   considerations, or on a modern new build as a bespoke design feature,
   different elements of high-specification structural glazing can be
   uniquely integrated to create beautiful links between spaces.

   Fixing methods can vary to suit each project’s requirements, with the
   option to secure all fixings into stonework wherever possible for a
   completely frameless look.

   Perhaps the most effective use of a glass link is in connecting old or
   listed buildings to new extensions. They work so well because, in many
   cases, heritage buildings just don’t have the space, structural
   integrity, or planning flexibility required to meet contemporary
--

   Adding an extension to an existing structure can often raise
   interesting challenges, particularly if the building is fragile. A
   glass link offers both an aesthetic division, and also a physical
   buffer between the varying architectural and construction standards
   between the two, while preserving original and historical integrity.

--

   Depending on the project you are specifying for, you might be
   considering the different ways you can create a sense of connection and
   cohesion. Glass links are the ideal solution for a range of
   architectural challenges, and will provide a tangible sense of luxury
   and uniqueness.

   For projects that require new designated walkways, a glass link is a
   fantastic addition. One of our favourite Cantifix projects, aptly named
   ‘Stepping Stone House’ , involved a beautiful outbuilding built on
   stilts over a lake, connected to the main house by a frameless glass

   For a truly unique architectural glass solution, a glass bridge link is
   undisputedly special. Another of our projects, Walkers Court, is the
   world’s first and only two-storey frameless glass bridge, using our
   first curved, sliding Pureglaze door. Forming part of the redevelopment

Glass links to introduce natural light

   In today’s modern world, we’ve become hugely dependent on artificial
   light – to the detriment of our physical and psychological health, and
--
   experience the benefits of natural light, as we simply aren’t getting
   enough of it.

   A glass link incorporates health-boosting natural light into your
   designs, and creates bright and open spaces. We’ve talked extensively
   about the health benefits of natural light and having a glass link can
   help to improve your physical and psychological health, and overall
   productivity.

--
   There are two options when it comes to fitting a roof onto a glass link
   – a glass roof, or a solid roof.

   Although fitting a glass roof onto a glass link might initially sound
   like a challenge, it isn’t so very different from any other structural
   glass roof design, so the technical details remain relatively similar.
   The main difference is that the roof will need to blend seamlessly with
   the glass link structure, particularly if aesthetics are the primary
   driver for this choice of installation..

   If the glass roof for the glazed link you are specifying is made up of
   multiple panels, then you may need to plan for internal supports below
   the structural silicone joints, between each glass unit. As a general
   rule, you’ll need internal support if the joints are over 1.3m. These
--
   security, these glass beams will be created using multiple layers of
   low iron glass.

   If you’re specifying a solid roof on a glass link design, then you will
   need to work alongside the glazing supplier and the builder to create
   the structure. A solid roof might not be as aesthetic as a glass roof,
   but it can offer privacy if there are overlooking properties.
--
Glass Links: final thoughts


   Glass links are a fantastic way to seamlessly connect the old with the
   new. As a material, glass is one of the most sympathetic and versatile
   materials to bring the old and new together in both traditional and
   modern architecture; it can give prominence to traditional features
   while creating contemporary spaces.


   Whether it’s a glass link corridor, or a small and discrete glass link,
   a ‘new-to-old’ design can create an almost invisible transition between
   structures. Linking old buildings with modern designs can present a
   challenge, but here at Cantifix, we take the time necessary to design
   the most suitable and beautiful installation possible.


   If you are looking to include a glass link on a client’s project, get
   in touch with us for help and guidance on the right solution for you.
   Our specialists can assist with any specification enquiries to maximise
   your project’s potential./text

Social Media Links – How SEO and Social Work Together for Link Building

     * Social Media Links – How SEO and Social Work Together for Link
       Building

   In this article
--
   connecting consumers with brands for business.

   Here are 6 questions and answers on the fundamentals of using a social
   media focused approach for link attraction and acquisition.

   How do you define “social linking”?

   I don’t really use that term but I suppose social linking most often
   means using social media channels to promote content that inspires
   social shares with links. A Tweet, Facebook status update or Pinterest
   pin that includes a link to the content being promoted are all examples
   of social links. Social shares with links = social links.

   It’s worth considering that social channels are also used to promote
   content to communities that include bloggers and journalists who may
   notice and link to the promoted source. Those are not social links per
   se, but they are inspired from content promoted through social
   channels.

   The advancement of social media and SEO integration has created a shift
   from seeking links purely for the potential impact on better search
   visibility to a content focused approach which emphasizes the impact
   that promoted and optimized content can have at attracting traffic
   directly. Social links achieved as a result of promoted content are
   either an equal or a secondary objective.

   How do you define the key types of social links?

   I think social links have different characteristics and so the
   definition depends on what you’re after.

   One marketer might look at links within social shares and discern value
   based on nofollow vs. those that pass PageRank because of a primary
   focus on traditional SEO.  Another marketer might evaluate links based
   on how much traffic was sent in a particular time frame, additional
   levels of shares of the link and overall propagation because of a focus
   on awareness, branding and reach.

   Other basic social link characteristics or types might include:
     * Content shared on social channels that includes a link (temporal
       and permanent)
     * Links contained within feeds (RSS, fire hose, syndicated)
     * Links contained on social profile web pages
     * Clean links that pass PageRank
     * Nofollow or crawler “un friendly” links
     * Shortened links/URLs

--
   interact with the information.  People that are empowered to publish
   through blogging, commenting or other social content sharing may decide
   to act on content they’ve been exposed to through social channels in
   the form of a link to it.

   It’s completely up to the discretion of search engines to adhere to
   nofollow, or not. Search engine policies and terms of use are not
   something we can control, so approaching direct and indirect benefits
   from links within social channels should focus on the ability to affect
   a target audience first and foremost. Doing so in a search engine
   friendly way can make that effort even more effective.

   If nofollow social links are of little SEO value now, who’s to say
   search engines won’t value them in a different way that could be come a
   SEO or Social SEO asset in the future? If the links provide value to
   the influencers and followers we’re trying to reach and they act on
   those links in a meaningful, measurable way, then the most important
   objective is achieved.

   How much of an impact do you believe social linking is having on search
   engine algorithms for non-logged in and non-personalized users?

   The links contained in the millions of social shares that happen on a
   regular basis is too rich (in my opinion) for search engines to ignore
   completely. If content resonates with a community and they actively
   share that content at an accelerated rate, I can’t imagine why a search
--
   usage.

   It’s important not to forget the ancillary impact of social shares with
   links that surface interesting content to people who decide to create
   “follow” links from their blogs, in comments or from other content
   sources that are outside of social networks. That’s an example of
   social linking that can impact search, albeit, indirectly.

   How do you view the measurement of social links, versus traditional
   links?

   Social shares with links are important for driving traffic and creating
   awareness of content. The extent that they can be a signal for generic
   search or logged in search is a value too. The authority of authors
   that share the links, the rate and quantity of social shares and the
   topics associated with source and destination are all worth considering
   when evaluating social links.

   The reason why the link is created, the context, is as important as the
   distinction of social vs. traditional. A blogger might link to another
   web page or blog within an article that contains hundreds of words.  A
   link within a Tweet might only involve a handful of words. But that
   same link could be re-tweeted hundreds of times in a very short period
   of time. It’s less likely that hundreds of bloggers would write blog
   posts including hundreds of words within a similarly short period of
   time.

   The anchor text and page/domain authority of the source are important
   values for traditional links. The annotation (since there is no anchor
   text with a social link) and rate of link duplication/propagation are
   important values for a social link. I think there’s still value to the
   cumulative number of social links but not in the same way as
   traditional page-to-page links.

   Is there an ROI on social linking, or should marketers approach the
   same as link building, in the sense that it is known to be a key
   cornerstone for achieving higher visibility?

   I would evaluate based on determining whether social linking is/text

   Strategy  Training team and Mission Website Platforms (MWP).

   Social Links was launched on April 1, 2021 and received valuable
   feedback during the initial 30-day pilot. We are happy to announce that
   Social Links is now available for all Missions to use!

What is Social Links?

   Social Links is a tool developed and owned by the Department of State
   that enables Department social media practitioners and content managers
   to provide their audiences with a secure way to view promoted content.
   Social Links enhances content strategy in a similar way as other
   popular tools on the market, such as Link in Bio or Linktree. The
   Social Links URL is placed in an Instagram account bio to drive traffic
   towards calls to action, downstream web properties and valuable content
   that your Mission wants to promote.

   LAB designed the first iteration of Social Links with Missions in mind
   by tailoring features to fit the specific needs of staff in the field
   based on real user feedback. It was designed as a plugin for WordPress
   and is already installed on the Mission Website Platform administrative
   site. It can be activated on your site by request and Social Link pages
   are hosted as part of your existing Mission website.

Why Use Social Links?
--
   Third-party platforms, like LinkTree, are not FedRAMP approved, which
   focuses on the security and protection of sensitive federal information
   within cloud technologies. By creating a State Department-owned version
   of these tools, Social Links is able provide valuable benefits specific
   to the Department’s unique needs. They include:
     * Security: Using a third-party platform that is not FedRAMP approved
       poses security risks to the Department. Since Social Links is
       installed on the Mission Website Platform, it inherits the security
       standards already in place on your current website.
     * Branding: Social Links provides cohesive branding through two style
       templates that match both the legacy Mission websites as well as
       the new redesigned sites launched this year.
     * Traffic: Using a third-party platform sends valuable traffic away
       from DOS web properties but because Social Links is hosted on your
       Mission website, all initial web traffic stays within DOS
       properties. Since Google Analytics is already in use for your
       Mission website, you have access to powerful analytics for Social
       Links as well.
     * Access: Mission staff can easily access and manage Social Links
       through your Mission website administration site.

     * Users that will need access to manage your Social Links page (Note:
       users that are not approved MWP users will need to complete an
       extra step requiring management approval to authorize site access;
       users must also have an america.gov account)

   The Legend of Zelda series (which is poorly named, considering that
   itʼs Link that does most of the legendary stuff) features Link as its
   main character. He is world renown for dressing like a flamboyant elf,
   swinging his big thing around (his sword, I mean), and never saying
   anything, even when heʼs being stoned to death by Octoroks.

Link

   A link (short for hyperlink) is an HTML object that allows you to jump
   to a new location when you click or tap it. Links are found on almost
   every webpage and provide a simple means of navigating between pages on
   the web.

   Links can be attached to text, images, or other HTML elements. Most
   text links are blue since that is the standard color web browsers use
   to display links. However, links can be any color since the style of
   the link text may be customized using HTML or CSS styles. In the early
   days of the web, links were underlined by default. Today, underlining
   links is less common.

   When a link is applied to an image, the link tag encapsulates, or
   surrounds the image tag. Since the image tag is nested inside the link
   tag, the image itself becomes a link. This method can be used to apply
   links to other elements such as div and span objects. However,
   since CSS can be used to stylize a link, an a tag with a CSS class or
   ID attribute is often used in place of a div or span tag.

Relative and Absolute Links

   The first link above is a "relative link" because it does not include
   the domain name. Instead, the link is relative to the current website.
   Any internal link on TechTerms.com, for example, does not need
   "https://techterms.com/" in the source. Rather, a relative link like
   "/definition/computer" is all that is required. Since the link starts
   with a forward slash, the path begins with the root directory. If a
   relative link does not start with a forward slash, the path is relative
   to the current URL.

   The second link above is an absolute link because it includes the
   domain name. Absolute links are required for external links, which
   direct you to another website. They may begin with "http" or "https."
   Absolute links may also begin with two forward slashes ("//"). This is
   interpreted as "http://" for pages served via HTTP and "https://" for
   pages served via HTTPS.

12.1 Introduction to links and anchors

   HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text
   and structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup
   languages is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This
   section introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic
   hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to
   another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the
   primary forces driving the success of the Web.

   A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link
   starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor,
   which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound
   bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document,
--

  12.1.1 Visiting a linked resource

   The default behavior associated with a link is the retrieval of another
   Web resource. This behavior is commonly and implicitly obtained by
   selecting the link (e.g., by clicking, through keyboard input, etc.).

   The following HTML excerpt contains two links, one whose destination
   anchor is an HTML document named "chapter2.html" and the other whose
--
See also this A href="../images/forest.gif"map of the enchanted forest./A
/BODY

   By activating these links (by clicking with the mouse, through keyboard
   input, voice commands, etc.), users may visit these resources. Note
   that the href attribute in each source anchor specifies the address of
   the destination anchor with a URI.

   The destination anchor of a link may be an element within an HTML
   document. The destination anchor must be given an anchor name and any
   URI addressing this anchor must include the name as its fragment
   identifier.
--
   (naming with the id attribute).

   Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose
   entries link to header elements H2, H3, etc., in the same document.
   Using the A element to create destination anchors, we would write:
H1Table of Contents/H1
PA href="#section1"Introduction/ABR
--
H3 id="section2.1"On a more personal note/H3
...section 2.1...

  12.1.2 Other link relationships

   By far the most common use of a link is to retrieve another Web
   resource, as illustrated in the previous examples. However, authors may
   insert links in their documents that express other relationships
   between resources than simply "activate this link to visit that related
   resource". Links that express other types of relationships have one or
   more link types specified in their source anchor.

   The roles of a link defined by A or LINK are specified via the rel and
   rev attributes.

   For instance, links defined by the LINK element may describe the
   position of a document within a series of documents. In the following
   excerpt, links within the document entitled "Chapter 5" point to the
   previous and next chapters:
HEAD
...other head information...
--
LINK rel="next" href="chapter6.html"
/HEAD

   The link type of the first link is "prev" and that of the second is
   "next" (two of several recognized link types). Links specified by LINK
   are not rendered with the document's contents, although user agents may
   render them in other ways (e.g., as navigation tools).

   Even if they are not used for navigation, these links may be
   interpreted in interesting ways. For example, a user agent that prints
   a series of HTML documents as a single document may use this link
   information as the basis of forming a coherent linear document. Further
   information is given below on using links for the benefit of search
   engines.

  12.1.3 Specifying anchors and links

   Although several HTML elements and attributes create links to other
   resources (e.g., the IMG element, the FORM element, etc.), this chapter
   discusses links and anchors created by the LINK and A elements. The
   LINK element may only appear in the head of a document. The A element
   may only appear in the body.

   When the A element's href attribute is set, the element defines a
   source anchor for a link that may be activated by the user to retrieve
   a Web resource. The source anchor is the location of the A instance and
   the destination anchor is the Web resource.

--
   opening a new HTML document in a different window, starting a new
   program to handle the resource, etc. Since the A element has content
   (text, images, etc.), user agents may render this content in such a way
   as to indicate the presence of a link (e.g., by underlining the
   content).

   When the name or id attributes of the A element are set, the element
--
   Authors may set the name and href attributes simultaneously in the same
   A instance.

   The LINK element defines a relationship between the current document
   and another resource. Although LINK has no content, the relationships
   it defines may be rendered by some user agents.

  12.1.4 Link titles

   The title attribute may be set for both A and LINK to add information
   about the nature of a link. This information may be spoken by a user
   agent, rendered as a tool tip, cause a change in cursor image, etc.

--

  12.1.5 Internationalization and links

   Since links may point to documents encoded with different character
   encodings, the A and LINK elements support the charset attribute. This
   attribute allows authors to advise user agents about the encoding of
   data at the other end of the link.

--
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED  -- named link end --

  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  accesskey   %Character;    #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  shape       %Shape;        rect      -- for use with client-side image maps --
  coords      %Coords;       #IMPLIED  -- for use with client-side image maps --
--

   href = uri [CT]
          This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus
          defining a link between the current element (the source anchor)
          and the destination anchor defined by this attribute.

   hreflang = langcode [CI]
--

   type = content-type [CI]
          This attribute gives an advisory hint as to the content type of
          the content available at the link target address. It allows user
          agents to opt to use a fallback mechanism rather than fetch the
          content if they are advised that they will get content in a
          content type they do not support.
          Authors who use this attribute take responsibility to manage the
          risk that it may become inconsistent with the content available
          at the link target address.
          For the current list of registered content types, please consult
          [MIMETYPES].

   rel = link-types [CI]
          This attribute describes the relationship from the current
          document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The
          value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.

   rev = link-types [CI]
          This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the
          anchor specified by the href attribute to the current document.
          The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link
          types.
--
   Each A element defines an anchor
    1. The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
    2. The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the
       destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
    3. The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly
       one link.

--
For more information about W3C, please consult the
A href="http://www.w3.org/"W3C Web site/A.

   This link designates the home page of the World Wide Web Consortium.
   When a user activates this link in a user agent, the user agent will
   retrieve the resource, in this case, an HTML document.

   User agents generally render links in such a way as to make them
   obvious to users (underlining, reverse video, etc.). The exact
   rendering depends on the user agent. Rendering may vary according to
   whether the user has already visited the link or not. A possible visual
   rendering of the previous link might be:

   one.". Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way
   when A defines an anchor only.

   Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another
   document. URIs that designate anchors contain a "#" character followed
   by the anchor name (the fragment identifier). Here are some examples of
   such URIs:
     * An absolute URI: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one
     * A relative URI: ./one.html#anchor-one or one.html#anchor-one
     * When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one

   Thus, a link defined in the file "two.html" in the same directory as
   "one.html" would refer to the anchor as follows:
...text before the link...
For more information, please consult A href="./one.html#anchor-one" anchor one
/A.
...text after the link...

   The A element in the following example specifies a link (with href) and
   creates a named anchor (with name) simultaneously:
I just returned from vacation! Here's a
A name="anchor-two"
   href="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png"
photo of my family at the lake./A.

   This example contains a link to a different type of Web resource (a PNG
   image). Activating the link should cause the image resource to be
   retrieved from the Web (and possibly displayed if the system has been
   configured to do so).

   attribute values.

  12.2.2 Nested links are illegal

   Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A
   element must not contain any other A elements.

   Since the DTD defines the LINK element to be empty, LINK elements may
   not be nested either.

  12.2.3 Anchors with the id attribute
--
       should still attempt to process it. It should alert the user and
       may allow the user to intervene and identify the document type.

12.3 Document relationships: the LINK element

!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY               -- a media-independent link --
!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
  hreflang    %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  media       %MediaDesc;    #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  

--

   This element defines a link. Unlike A, it may only appear in the HEAD
   section of a document, although it may appear any number of times.
   Although LINK has no content, it conveys relationship information that
   may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar
   with a drop-down menu of links).

   This example illustrates how several LINK definitions may appear in the
   HEAD section of a document. The current document is "Chapter2.html".
   The rel attribute specifies the relationship of the linked document
   with the current document. The values "Index", "Next", and "Prev" are
   explained in the section on link types.
!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd"
HTML
--
  12.3.1 Forward and reverse links

   The rel and rev attributes play complementary roles -- the rel
   attribute specifies a forward link and the rev attribute specifies a
   reverse link.

   Consider two documents A and B.
--

   Both attributes may be specified simultaneously.

  12.3.2 Links and external style sheets

   When the LINK element links an external style sheet to a document, the
   type attribute specifies the style sheet language and the media
   attribute specifies the intended rendering medium or media. User agents
   may save time by retrieving from the network only those style sheets
--

   Media types are further discussed in the section on style sheets.

  12.3.3 Links and search engines

   Authors may use the LINK element to provide a variety of information to
   search engines, including:
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, written in another human
       language.
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, designed for different
       media, for instance a version especially suited for printing.
     * Links to the starting page of a collection of documents.

   The examples below illustrate how language information, media types,
   and link types may be combined to improve document handling by search
   engines.

   In the following example, we use the hreflang attribute to tell search
   engines where to find Dutch, Portuguese, and Arabic versions of a
   document. Note the use of the charset attribute for the Arabic manual.
   Note also the use of the lang attribute to indicate that the value of
   the title attribute for the LINK element designating the French manual
   is in French.
HEAD
TITLEThe manual in English/TITLE

   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * target (target frame information)

   In HTML, links and references to external images, applets,
   form-processing programs, style sheets, etc. are always specified by a
   URI. Relative URIs are resolved according to a base URI, which may come
   from a variety of sources. The BASE element allows authors to specify a

   specific to them.

   Note. For versions of HTTP that define a Link header, user agents
   should handle these headers exactly as LINK elements in the document.

   (refer to section 19.6.3).

What is deep linking?

   Deep links are a type of link that send users directly to an app
   instead of a website or a store. They are used to send users straight
   to specific in-app locations, saving users the time and energy locating
   a particular page themselves – significantly improving the user
--

   Deep linking does this by specifying a custom URL scheme (iOS Universal
   Links) or an intent URL (on Android devices) that opens your app if
   it’s already installed. Deep links can also be set to direct users to
   specific events or pages, which could tie into campaigns that you may
   want to run.

Why are deep links important?

   Deep links produce a seamless user journey that reduces churn and
   increases the likelihood of an install. They let you make sophisticated
   campaigns while providing a better user experience, moving users onto
   your app in a single click.

   Deep links also create the opportunity for easier incentivization. It’s
   simple to persuade people to try a new experience when a potential
   prize or offer is sent to them via a retargeting campaign. For example,
   let’s say you have a music app and want to promote a new album, so you
   allocate budget to be spent on a popular website. However, you want the
   user to listen to the sample in-app, not just on the website (where
   they are only exposed to the album cover). Here you need a deep link to
   send them directly to the correct page in your app, offering a seamless
   user experience.

--

What are deferred deep links?

   Deep links are a smart way to drive conversions while offering a
   positive user experience, but what happens if the user is deep linked
   into an app they don’t have installed? This is when deferred deep links
   come in to play.

   If a user clicks on a deep link and doesn’t have the app installed,
   they can be deferred to the App Store instead. The genius of deferred
   deep linking is that when that user installs and opens up the app, they
   can still be sent to the in-app location where you initially wanted

   What is a link?

   It is a connection from one web resource to another. A link has two
   ends, An anchor and direction. The link starts at the “source” anchor
   and points to the “destination” anchor, which may be any Web resource
   such as an image, a video clip, a sound bite, a program, an HTML
   document or an element within an HTML document. You will find many
   websites or social media platforms ( Like YouTube, and Instagram )
   which link an image to a URL or a text to a URL etc.

   This basically means that by using the ‘a’ tag, you can link 1 element
   of the code to another element that may/may not be in your code.

   HTML Link Syntax

   Links are specified in HTML using the “a” tag.

   Changing Link Colours in HTML

   Different types of links appear in different formats such as:
    1. An unvisited link appears underlined and blue in colour by default.
    2. A visited link appears underlined and purple in colour by default.
    3. An active link appears underlined and red in colour by default.

   The appearance of links can be changed by using CSS.

   (December 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)

   In computer science, link time refers to the period of time, during the
   creation of a computer program, in which a linker is being applied to
   that program.^[1]^[2]^[3] Link time occurs after compile time and
   before runtime (when a program is executed).

   It is common to speak of link time operations (the operations performed
   by a linker) or link time requirements (programming language
   requirements that must be met by compiled source code for it to be
   successfully linked).

Link time operations[edit]

   The operations performed at link time usually include fixing up the
   addresses of externally referenced objects and functions, various kinds
   of cross module checks (e.g. type checks on externally visible
   identifiers and in some languages instantiation of templates). Some
   optimizing compilers delay code generation until link time because it
   is here that information about a complete program is available to them.
   Resolving external variables in a program is also done at link time.

   The link-time optimization (LTO), when enabled, occurs at link time.

Link time requirements[edit]

   The definition of a programming language may specify link time
   requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled
   (e.g. the maximum number of characters in an externally visible
   identifier that must be considered significant)./text

   What is a Hyperlink? HTML Links Explained with Examples

   Let's begin with a quick question: How did you land on this article and
   this site today?
--
   how powerful this element is – it will get you to any part of the
   Internet just by clicking on a link.

   So, what are links and hyperlinks in HTML?

What are Links and Hyperlinks in HTML?

   A link is a chain that connects pages both within a website and to
   other websites. Without links, we wouldn't have any websites.

   For example, let's have a look at this URL,
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/. When you type it in the address bar it
   will take you to the official freeCodeCamp site.

   In simpler terms we can say that links are just the web addresses of
   web page that allow you to connect with different servers.

   Perhaps you are wondering, then, what a Hyperlink might be? Well, they
   are what allows us to link documents to other documents or resources
   via refrences called anchor tags. They are a fundamental concept behind
   the World Wide Web which makes navigation between web pages easier via
   links.
--
   For example, if you were to click HERE, you will land in my profile
   with a list of my other articles. That's a hyperlink.

How to Create Links in HTML

How to use a links

   You can create a basic link by wrapping the text (or any other related
   content) in the a/a element and using the href attribute which
   contains the address.

--

How to style links

   There are usually links inserted in the .html file that link the main
   to the styling and funtionality file. And they're typically named with
   the .css and .js file extensions.

   Here's how to link to a CSS file:
!DOCTYPE html
html
head
--
/body
/html

   And here's how to link to a JS file. You can either place what you want
   linked in the head or body tag.
!DOCTYPE html
html
--
/body
/html

How to Link Within a Site

Links to different page within a Site

   You use this type of link to direct a user to different pages on the
   same site.

   Take a case where your site has 5 pages. You'll want a user to be able
   to access all the pages from one point, like the navbar.

   First you will have to create all the pages and then link them. In this
   case we will do it like this:
nav
    ul
--
    /ul
/nav

   The above example will link to different parts of the site – the 'Home'
   page, 'Services', 'Pricing', and 'About', in that order. Writing only
   the name of the file is enough because all the work is shared in the
   same work folder.

How to Link to a specific section of a site

   Let's say that, somewhere on your site, you mentioned a particular
   topic or page. And you would like your readers or visitors to jump
--
   page. Maybe it is a paragraph – if so, this is how it would look:
p id="detailed-info" Read more on Upcoming Events /p

   After this in your link add the id in the href:
a href="#detailed-info" Read more about upcoming events /a

   This code will take them right to the Upcoming Events section.

Other Types of Links in HTML

How to Link to a Downloadable file

   When you want to link to a resource that a user needs to download
   rather than open in the browser, you can use the download attribute.
   This provides a default save filename.

How to Add E-mail Links

   Email Links allow us to create hyperlinks to an email address. You can
   create these links using the HTML a/a tag – but in this case,
   instead of passing a URL, we pass the recipient’s email address.

   You use the mailto attribute to specify the email address in your

  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
/a

HTML Link Attributes

   HTML links have various attributes that you can use to provide more
   speicifc information. Here are some of the most commonly used.
    1. href attribute
       The href attribute defines the target URL address for an HTML link.
       It makes the marked word or phrase clickable. The href attribute
       creates a hyperlink to another web page, and HTML links would not
       work as intended without it.
    2. target attribute
       The target attribute defines where the HTML link will be opened.
       Ever visited a website and when you click on a link it
       automatically opens in a new tab? Well that's the work of this
       attribute.

   Here are all the possible options you can use with the target
   attribute:
     * -blank = Opens the link in a new tab. Mostly used to avoid losing
       a site's visitors. By default, when a user clicks a link it opens
       in the same tab – but this changes that.

What is the difference between a physical link and a symbolic link?

   Julioarenas

   Share

   If you’re here is because you want to understand how links work, but
   before we understand it we must know how certain things work because it
   is an environment variable and how it differs from the other type of
   variables, also how the PAHT variable works, which has to do with the
   links in a script and that means the ASCII text within the text and how
   we make bash read it, well, actually there are many things.

   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:
--
   also environment variables, and because of this PAHT is the most
   important environment variable, if we change a small portion of the
   command path it stops working, PAHT saves the paths of “pwd , ls, mkdir
   “and many more, in other words, PHAT saves the LINKS of these commands
   inside an executable file.

   RELATIVE ROUTE:
--
   A script in LINUX is a file that contains different commands that are
   interpreted by the shell to execute them by means of its path or rather
   its LINK. The shell executes them as if it had written them in PROMPT.
   When we write a SCRIPT in a file we do it through a LINK called SHEBANG
   which gives the BASH path to read the script.

   ASCII:
--
   that is, it replaces letters with numbers which are interpreted by
   machines in a bit manner.

   I mention all this as a basis for understanding the links and their
   logical relationship of its operation, so let’s talk about links.

TO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO!
--
   PAHT others to communicate or read directly as SHEBANG that places BASH
   to read the file.

   In Linux a link can be physical or symbolic:

   PHYSICAL LINK
   Physical links can only be created for files and not for directories,
   the PHYSICAL LINK is the name given to a file in another location which
   contains the path or information that is put to it.
   example:

   create a link from the current location;

   PROMPT ~$: home/ holbertonschool-low_level_programming

   WE CREATE A FILE ~$: emacs bettyCool

   WE CREATE THE LINK ~$: ln bettyCool holberton

   We put “ls” to see the content~$: ls; holberton

   There are two files, this means that if I enter holberton it will show
   me what has bettyCool, since both have the same content. And a
   characteristic of the PHYSICAL LINKS is that if you delete one of the
   two the other still exists without any problem.

   SYMBOLIC LINKS

   The symbolic links have the same function as a physical but the
   difference is that it does not contain the data of the file, instead it
   points to that folder or to the registry where the data is located. In
   other words it is like a shortcut in Windows that when I click it takes
   me to where the content I need, it would be like a kind of hyperlink of
   a web page. If the destination file is deleted the symbolic link will
   be unusable, because it will not be able to refer to the file it was
   pointing to, since it is not there.

   Symbolic links have the same syntax as the physical one but with a
   small only that we add the option -s to indicate that we want to make a
   symbolic link.
   Example:
--
   PROMPT ~$ : ls/home/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/

   we have files ~$: bettyCool
   We create the symbolic link from the current path and we create a new
   home file called ENIAC that points to the bettyCool path.

   Now we see that after creating the symbolic link we go to the home
   folder and with “ls -l” we will see that ENIAC points to the ROUTE of
   bettyCool, and if we enter ENIAC it shows me the content of bettyCool,
   this would be the same and practically a C pointer.

When you open files or directories very repeatedly, links are your best tool
to shorten time and eliminate headaches,
use them as you will look very professional in doing so.
Thank you and I hope this information helps you with Linux./text

Hard links and soft links in Linux explained

   Let's discuss when you should use hard links or soft links, and the
   syntax of the ln command.

   most people. This is a frustrating feeling, but it is also one that
   often is easily remedied. Sometimes, it only takes someone explaining
   the concept in "plain English," aka layman's terms. That is the goal of
   this article. I want to talk about hard links and soft (symbolic) links
   in the most basic terms possible. You may realize that this concept,
   which is often a struggle for sysadmins, is quite simple. If nothing
   else, I take you through the syntax to create these links (which many
   people find difficult to remember). So let's get down to it.

Hard links

   The concept of a hard link is the most basic we will discuss today.
   Every file on the Linux filesystem starts with a single hard link. The
   link is between the filename and the actual data stored on the
   filesystem. Creating an additional hard link to a file means a few
   different things. Let's discuss these.

   First, you create a new filename pointing to the exact same data as the
   old filename. This means that the two filenames, though different,
   point to identical data. For example, if I create file
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/link_test and write hello world in the file, I
   have a single hard link between the file name link_test and the file
   content hello world.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l
total 4
-rw-rw-r--. 1 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test

   Take note of the link count here (1).

   Next, I create a new hard link in /tmp to the exact same file using the
   following command:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln link_test /tmp/link_new

--
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 link_test
-rw-rw-r--. 2 tcarrigan tcarrigan 12 Aug 29 14:27 /tmp/link_new

   The primary difference here is the filename. The link count has also
   been changed (2). Most notably, if I cat the new file's contents, it
   displays the original data.
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ cat /tmp/link_new
hello world

   When changes are made to one filename, the other reflects those
   changes. The permissions, link count, ownership, timestamps, and file
   content are the exact same. If the original file is deleted, the data
   still exists under the secondary hard link. The data is only removed
   from your drive when all links to the data have been removed. If you
   find two files with identical properties but are unsure if they are
   hard-linked, use the ls -i command to view the inode number. Files that
   are hard-linked together share the same inode number.
--

Hard limits

   While useful, there are some limitations to what hard links can do. For
   starters, they can only be created for regular files (not directories
   or special files). Also, a hard link cannot span multiple filesystems.
   They only work when the new hard link exists on the same filesystem as
   the original.

Soft links

   Commonly referred to as symbolic links, soft links link together
   non-regular and regular files. They can also span multiple filesystems.
   By definition, a soft link is not a standard file, but a special file
   that points to an existing file. Let's look at how to create a soft
   link. I use the ln -s command and the following syntax:

--

   In the example below, I create a new file at
   /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test with the file content soft Hello
   world. I then create a soft link to that file at /tmp/soft_link_new:
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ln -s /home/tcarrigan/demo/soft_link_test /tmp/soft_lin
k_new
[tcarrigan@server demo]$ ls -l soft_link_test /tmp/soft_link_new
--

   All of this sounds great, but there are some drawbacks to using a soft
   link. The biggest concern is data loss and data confusion. If the
   original file is deleted, the soft link is broken. This situation is
   referred to as a dangling soft link. If you were to create a new file
   with the same name as the original, your dangling soft link is no
   longer dangling at all. It points to the new file created, whether this
   was your intention or not, so be sure to keep this in mind.

Hard or soft?

   There is no clear answer here. The best link is the type that fits your
   particular situation. While these concepts can be tricky to remember,
   the syntax is pretty straightforward, so that is a plus! To keep the
   two easily separated in your mind, I leave you with this:
     * A hard link always points a filename to data on a storage device.
     * A soft link always points a filename to another filename, which
       then points to information on a storage device.

   Hopefully, this helps you keep them separated as you work your way
   through the link types needed to accomplish your daily goals!

What is link aggregation?

   Link aggregation allows you to combine multiple Ethernet links into a
   single logical link between two networked devices.

   Link aggregation is sometimes called by other names:
     * Ethernet bonding
     * Ethernet teaming
     * Link bonding
     * Link bundling
     * Link teaming
     * Network interface controller (NIC) bonding
     * NIC teaming
     * Port aggregation
--
   another switch, a server, a network attached storage (NAS) device, or a
   multi-port access point.

   Network devices and management functions treat the link aggregation
   group (LAG) of multiple Ethernet connections as a single link. For
   example, you can include a LAG in a virtual local area network (VLAN).
   You can also configure more than one LAG on the same switch, or add
   more than two Ethernet links to the same LAG (the maximum number of
   links per LAG depends on your device).

   Some network devices support Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP),
   which helps to prevent errors in the link aggregation setup process.

   Unmanaged switches do not support link aggregation.


What are the benefits of link aggregation?

   Link aggregation offers the following benefits:
     * Increased reliability and availability. If one of the physical
       links in the LAG goes down, traffic is dynamically and
       transparently reassigned to one of the other physical links.
     * Better use of physical resources. Traffic can be load-balanced
       across the physical links.
     * Increased bandwidth. The aggregated physical links deliver higher
       bandwidth than each individual link.
     * Cost effectiveness. A physical network upgrade can be expensive,
       especially if it requires new cable runs. Link aggregation
       increases bandwidth without requiring new equipment.


What are the different types of LAGs?

   The two primary types of LAGs are static (also known as manual) and
   dynamic. Dynamic LAGs use Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP) to
   negotiate settings between the two connected devices.

   Some devices support static LAGs, but do not support dynamic LAGs with
--
   supports LACP.

   Linux-based devices, such as NETGEAR ReadyNAS storage devices, often
   offer several additional types of link aggregation that provide
   increased fault tolerance or load balancing instead of increased
   bandwidth.


What is Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)?

   Link Aggregation Control Protocol is an IEEE standard defined in IEEE
   802.3ad. LACP lets devices send Link Aggregation Control Protocol Data
   Units (LACPDUs) to each other to establish a link aggregation
   connection. You still need to configure the LAG on each device, but
   LACP helps prevent one of the most common problems that can occur
   during the process of setting up link aggregation: misconfigured LAG
   settings. If the devices detect that they cannot establish a link
   aggregation connection, they do not try to establish it, and the link
   shows as “down” in the admin interface.

   Another useful feature of LACP is that when one member link stops
   sending LACPDUs (if the cable is unplugged, for example), it is removed
   from the LAG. This helps to minimize packet loss.

--
   both devices support LACP.


How do I set up link aggregation in my network?

   The following instructions describe in general terms how to set up link
   aggregation between two devices in your network. For more information
   about setting up link aggregation on specific NETGEAR devices, see the
   NETGEAR product support page for your product. To find your product’s
   support page, visit https://www.netgear.com/support/ and enter your
   product model number in the search box.

   To set up link aggregation between two devices in your network:
    1. Make sure that both devices support link aggregation.
    2. Configure the LAG on each of the two devices.
    3. Make sure that the LAG that you create on each device has the same
       settings for port speed, duplex mode, flow control, and MTU size
--
       the LAG on each device.
    7. Verify that the port LED for each connected port on each NETGEAR
       switch is blinking green.
    8. Verify in the admin interface for each device that the link is UP.

   Everything You Need To Know About App Links

   Mobile App Links are a type of mobile URLs. They make it possible to
   link to specific pages or screens of an app. They also allow you to
   link your website pages to the respective screens in your app.

What do App Links do?


    They close the loop between the creation of content, its discovery
    and app downloads by creating unique links for different pages or
    screens of an app. Thus, App Links allow users to click links to view
    content directly in the app (if already downloaded), or download the
    app to view content present on any particular screen of the app.

--

   Nopes, you can only share the mobile App URLs with others. Since there
   is no such thing as an address bar for apps, it is not possible to type
   App Links in the address bar.

What theory is App Links based on?

   App Links is based on the principle of ‘Deep-linking‘, which involve
   linking to specific screens (pages) within apps and launching mobile
   apps via links.

Which platforms do App Links support?

   App url deeplinks is cross platform

   App Links are cross-platform and currently support iOS, Android and
   Windows Phones. However, they can also be extended to support other
   platforms.

Are App Links free?

   App Links are open source, so you can use them without paying for it.
   You can also change them to suit any platform or environment.

How do they work?

   They let you link from an app to specific screens within the same or a
   different app. In short, they work like URLs for websites.

   How App Links work

Example 1 – Linking to a screen in the same app

   If I have opened a Facebook page on my Facebook app, and if I want to
   share a link of that page (without visiting the Facebook website) from
   the app with my friend, then I will use its URL (App Link) and share it
   with my friend using the messages or chat window.

Linking Pinterest app from inside of a Facebook app

   Provided that some conditions are satisfied, you can link to a tweet in
   Twitter app from your Facebook app using App Links . The requirements
   are that both Facebook and Twitter need to have App Links enabled. Now,
   Facebook app has built-in App Links functionality, but Twitter has a
   different set of deeplinks as part of its feature called Twitter Cards.
   Since, not both the apps have App Links, it is not possible to link
   them.

   However, you can link an app like Pinterest (which supports App Links)
   with Facebook app. All you have to do is to go to a screen in
   Pinterest, copy the App Link (or URI), then open your Facebook app and
   paste it in your status update. Your friends who click on the link on a
   desktop will be shown download links for Pinterest app for platforms
   like iOS, Android or Windows Phone; however, they won’t being able to
   download the Pinterest app on their laptop. The friends who click on
   the link through a mobile device, will be directed to the image URL
   (regardless of the mobile platform) if they have the Pinterest app
   installed; if they don’t have the Pinterest app, they will be directed
   to the download link for that particular platform, clicking on which
   would take them to the image URL.

What is the minimum requirement for App Links to work?

   For App Links to work, the linking and the linked apps should have App
   Links enabled.

How to enable App Links for an app?

   App Links can be enabled for an app by defining customized Universal
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) for that app and adding specific tags in
   the codes of that app.

What are the different types of App links in the market?

   App Links is a name of a certain type of deeplinks which have been
   instituted by AppLinks.org. Some other companies have also developed
   links for apps, with a different set of features compared to App Links.
   They are as follows:

Cellogic Ltd’s Deeplink

   The Deeplink.me services help in making your app pages linkable through
   deeplinks,  just like App Links. The links build using deeplink.me
   function for app pages of an app on all platforms. They also offer
   translation rules for customized URIs, user engagement analytics, link
   fallbacks in the case of an emergency/failure and Twitter Card (see

Tapstream’s Deferred Links


    Links to a specific screen or a landing within an app through URIs,
    text ads or image ads. Clicking on the link or the ad takes users to
    the destination screen within the app. It does this in two ways

    1. If the user has the destination app installed, it directly takes
--
       as the app is getting installed it displays a message indicating
       that the user will be directed to the landing page.

   Onboarding Links by Tapstream

Users are directed to a particular screen on downloading an app for the first
time

   Tapstream’s Deferred Links are mainly for app marketing companies who
   intend to make use of Landing Pages within their apps to generate
   quality leads. The Deferred Links are paid, and have different price
   points.

Twitter’s App Cards

   Twitter’s App Cards
   One of the several different Twitter Cards, through App Cards you can
   tweet a link to any webpage on your website and Twitter will
   automatically display your tweet alongside an App Card. This App Card
   would show all the data regarding your app like screenshot, ratings,
   free or paid app, description and a link to its App Store depending on
   the mobile platform you prefer. For this to work, you should have the
   App Card enabled in your website and have specified your card type and
   app IDs for iOS and Android. Twitter App Card with detailed app
   information

Twitter App Card showing automatically embedded information about an app
whose download link was tweeted

   This App Card can also show links to specific pages within the app for
   the website, provided the app has deeplinking enabled.
   URX’s Omnilinks, Omnilinks.js and App Search
   Enabling Omnilinks and deeplink Analytics for an app
--
Analytics

   URX has developed two separate approaches for deeplinking within apps.
   Omnilinks helps users to link to specifc pages within the same or a
   different app. This approach is especially useful if a user doesn’t
   have an app installed, in which case the user is directed to the
   download link for the app on the platform-specific app store. And, if
   the user already has an app installed, he is directly taken to the
   specific screen within the app. This facility is extremely useful to
   marketers who intend to increase their app downloads by directing
--
   required. You just need to add ‘http://urx.io/’ before your URI to
   create omnilink.
   Requirement: For Omnilinks to work, an app must have deeplinks, without
   which the URX Omnilinks are to link between apps. Similarly, websites
   must have appropriate meta tags enabled to make it possible to link
   them to an app. URX’s Omnilinks support App Links tags, so if you App
   Links tags enabled, you just have to prepend the URX code to the URI.
   App Search: This feature allows apps to scour the content present on
   other apps and also link to the respective pages of that app.

Are all these different types of App Links (i.e deep links) cross-compatible?

   Unfortunately, only some of these compatible with each other (App Links
   and URX’s Omnilinks). The reason for that is, all the services are
--
Which companies have adopted AppLinks?

   Facebook, a partner in the AppLinks initiative, has implemented them
   across most of its features. App Links currently supports News Feed,
   pages, status updates and links shared by apps. Top mobile apps like
   Mailbox, Quip, and Spotify also have deeply integrated AppLinks.
   Some major companies have recently made their content available for
   linking. They are: Pinterest, Redfin, Goodreads, Edomondo, Hulu,
--
   Tumblr, EyeEm, Houzz, Flickr, Vevo, Vimeo, Rhapsody, Fancy.com, iHeart,
   Songkick, and DailyMotion.

Why are App Links a good investment of your time and resources?

   App Links are slightly complicated, and might take some time to
   implement and a little more to perfect, but they give you so many other
   things in return.
   First of all, they help you drive your app downloads, regardless of the
   platform, if visitors happen to stumble across the app download link.
   This will, in turn, also lead to an increase in paid app or ad revenue
   from your mobile app.
   f the familiarity and convenience that App Links provide. This also
   increase the visibility of your app, which unlike your website, stays
   hidden from the eyes of people most of the times.
   Most importantly, since not many companies have implemented App Links,
   they will also lend your app or website a novel factor. So, people will
   keep coming back or download the app just to experience something new.

How do I start implementing App Links from scratch?

   If you are implementing App Links for the first time, then use Facebook
   SDK to deeplink your mobile app. Facebook has provided comprehensive
   documentation along with how-tos (with screenshots) on how to implement
   App Links as well as all the special features. Also, using Facebook SDK
   would help you leverage your website’s social media presence to
   increase downloads of your app and thus generate revenue.

What are some new or additional features of App Links?

   Analytics
   App Links have inbuilt functionality to measure and analyse how they
   are being used with apps. They can track the clicks, the landing pages,
   time, date, frequency and other data to give you a comprehensive lists
   and graphs of analytics. Using these analytics, you can optimize the
   integration of App Links into your app to enrich the experience of
   users or generate revenue from your app. To set up Analytics for App
   Links you have include lines of code on Bolts SDK, which is found in
   Facebook SDK. Since there is no SDK to support Bolts SDK except that of
   Facebook, this functionality is difficult to implement with other
   services.
--

Issues, Problems, Worries and Difficulties:

     * The cross-platform compatibility of App Links also makes it a bit
       more complicated. There are three major mobile platforms (iOS,
       Android and Windows Phone) in the mobile app market. If you have
       the same app available on different platforms, you have to define
--
       an app, as app use much less real and are extremely simplistic in
       nature.
     * Linking to a screen from one app to a different app can also be
       really disruptive. For example, if I link from Facebook app to The
       Huffington Post and I used my Twitter account to log in to The
       Huffington Post, then I will be taken to the Twitter app first to
       login, after which I will redirected to The Huffington Post app. It
       is also possible that I might be directed to the download link for
       Twitter app even though it is already installed on my smartphone.
     * Most of the services listed here (excluding App Links) are not
       available to Windows Phone apps. So, there is still no way for App
       Links to deeplink to your Windows Phone app.

   PS: I have used ‘screen’ and ‘page’ interchangeably for an app. Both
   mean the same, a screen or a page within an app. Also, I have used App
   Links instead of the oft-used generic term for mobile app links i.e
   ‘deeplinks’ to make understanding this new concept simpler.

   In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a

   The technology behind the World Wide Web, the Hypertext Transfer

   intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors
   to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of
   so-called "deep" linking is therefore built into the Web technology of
   HTTP and URLs by default—while a site can attempt to restrict deep
   links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the World Wide Web

Usage[edit]

   Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into

The Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Violence Toward Humans

   People who hurt animals don’t stop with animals. There is an
   established link between cruelty to animals and violence toward
   humans — regularly referred to as “The Link.”

   This link makes it critically important that cruelty toward animals be
   taken seriously by law enforcement, and by society at large. This is
   for the sake of the animals themselves, and for people who are also at
   risk.

Research Shows the Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Toward Humans

   Ample research backs up the finding that there is a direct link between
   acts of cruelty to animals and violence toward humans. This includes
   child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse and other violent behavior.

   abusers are in fact five times as likely to also harm other humans.

   school massacres also committed acts of cruelty to animals — generally
   against cats and dogs.

   Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition — a group
   focusing on the intersection between violence toward animals and humans
   — has written often about animal abuse being an indication of domestic
   violence, or what’s called a “predictor crime.”

The Law Must Protect Animals and Punish Animal Abusers

   Both because animals themselves need protection, and because of the

   animals must be taken seriously under the law.

   The meaning of link as "connect or join up" does not require an object.

   The meaning of relate as "show a connection between" can take an
