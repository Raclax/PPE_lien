   A literature review found 27 studies looking at the effect of physical
   activity on brain function in people over 60 years of age. In 26 of the
   studies there was a clear link between physical activity levels and
   cognitive performance, suggesting that exercise might be an effective
   way to reduce cognitive decline in later life.
