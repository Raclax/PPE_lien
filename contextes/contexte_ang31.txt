12.1 Introduction to links and anchors

   HTML offers many of the conventional publishing idioms for rich text
   and structured documents, but what separates it from most other markup
   languages is its features for hypertext and interactive documents. This
   section introduces the link (or hyperlink, or Web link), the basic
   hypertext construct. A link is a connection from one Web resource to
   another. Although a simple concept, the link has been one of the
   primary forces driving the success of the Web.

   A link has two ends -- called anchors -- and a direction. The link
   starts at the "source" anchor and points to the "destination" anchor,
   which may be any Web resource (e.g., an image, a video clip, a sound
   bite, a program, an HTML document, an element within an HTML document,
--

  12.1.1 Visiting a linked resource

   The default behavior associated with a link is the retrieval of another
   Web resource. This behavior is commonly and implicitly obtained by
   selecting the link (e.g., by clicking, through keyboard input, etc.).

   The following HTML excerpt contains two links, one whose destination
   anchor is an HTML document named "chapter2.html" and the other whose
--
See also this <A href="../images/forest.gif">map of the enchanted forest.</A>
</BODY>

   By activating these links (by clicking with the mouse, through keyboard
   input, voice commands, etc.), users may visit these resources. Note
   that the href attribute in each source anchor specifies the address of
   the destination anchor with a URI.

   The destination anchor of a link may be an element within an HTML
   document. The destination anchor must be given an anchor name and any
   URI addressing this anchor must include the name as its fragment
   identifier.
--
   (naming with the id attribute).

   Thus, for example, an author might create a table of contents whose
   entries link to header elements H2, H3, etc., in the same document.
   Using the A element to create destination anchors, we would write:
<H1>Table of Contents</H1>
<P><A href="#section1">Introduction</A><BR>
--
<H3 id="section2.1">On a more personal note</H3>
...section 2.1...

  12.1.2 Other link relationships

   By far the most common use of a link is to retrieve another Web
   resource, as illustrated in the previous examples. However, authors may
   insert links in their documents that express other relationships
   between resources than simply "activate this link to visit that related
   resource". Links that express other types of relationships have one or
   more link types specified in their source anchor.

   The roles of a link defined by A or LINK are specified via the rel and
   rev attributes.

   For instance, links defined by the LINK element may describe the
   position of a document within a series of documents. In the following
   excerpt, links within the document entitled "Chapter 5" point to the
   previous and next chapters:
<HEAD>
...other head information...
--
<LINK rel="next" href="chapter6.html">
</HEAD>

   The link type of the first link is "prev" and that of the second is
   "next" (two of several recognized link types). Links specified by LINK
   are not rendered with the document's contents, although user agents may
   render them in other ways (e.g., as navigation tools).

   Even if they are not used for navigation, these links may be
   interpreted in interesting ways. For example, a user agent that prints
   a series of HTML documents as a single document may use this link
   information as the basis of forming a coherent linear document. Further
   information is given below on using links for the benefit of search
   engines.

  12.1.3 Specifying anchors and links

   Although several HTML elements and attributes create links to other
   resources (e.g., the IMG element, the FORM element, etc.), this chapter
   discusses links and anchors created by the LINK and A elements. The
   LINK element may only appear in the head of a document. The A element
   may only appear in the body.

   When the A element's href attribute is set, the element defines a
   source anchor for a link that may be activated by the user to retrieve
   a Web resource. The source anchor is the location of the A instance and
   the destination anchor is the Web resource.

--
   opening a new HTML document in a different window, starting a new
   program to handle the resource, etc. Since the A element has content
   (text, images, etc.), user agents may render this content in such a way
   as to indicate the presence of a link (e.g., by underlining the
   content).

   When the name or id attributes of the A element are set, the element
--
   Authors may set the name and href attributes simultaneously in the same
   A instance.

   The LINK element defines a relationship between the current document
   and another resource. Although LINK has no content, the relationships
   it defines may be rendered by some user agents.

  12.1.4 Link titles

   The title attribute may be set for both A and LINK to add information
   about the nature of a link. This information may be spoken by a user
   agent, rendered as a tool tip, cause a change in cursor image, etc.

--

  12.1.5 Internationalization and links

   Since links may point to documents encoded with different character
   encodings, the A and LINK elements support the charset attribute. This
   attribute allows authors to advise user agents about the encoding of
   data at the other end of the link.

--
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  name        CDATA          #IMPLIED  -- named link end --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
  hreflang    %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  accesskey   %Character;    #IMPLIED  -- accessibility key character --
  shape       %Shape;        rect      -- for use with client-side image maps --
  coords      %Coords;       #IMPLIED  -- for use with client-side image maps --
--

   href = uri [CT]
          This attribute specifies the location of a Web resource, thus
          defining a link between the current element (the source anchor)
          and the destination anchor defined by this attribute.

   hreflang = langcode [CI]
--

   type = content-type [CI]
          This attribute gives an advisory hint as to the content type of
          the content available at the link target address. It allows user
          agents to opt to use a fallback mechanism rather than fetch the
          content if they are advised that they will get content in a
          content type they do not support.
          Authors who use this attribute take responsibility to manage the
          risk that it may become inconsistent with the content available
          at the link target address.
          For the current list of registered content types, please consult
          [MIMETYPES].

   rel = link-types [CI]
          This attribute describes the relationship from the current
          document to the anchor specified by the href attribute. The
          value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link types.

   rev = link-types [CI]
          This attribute is used to describe a reverse link from the
          anchor specified by the href attribute to the current document.
          The value of this attribute is a space-separated list of link
          types.
--
   Each A element defines an anchor
    1. The A element's content defines the position of the anchor.
    2. The name attribute names the anchor so that it may be the
       destination of zero or more links (see also anchors with id).
    3. The href attribute makes this anchor the source anchor of exactly
       one link.

<A href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C Web site</A>.

   This link designates the home page of the World Wide Web Consortium.
   When a user activates this link in a user agent, the user agent will
   retrieve the resource, in this case, an HTML document.

   User agents generally render links in such a way as to make them
   obvious to users (underlining, reverse video, etc.). The exact
   rendering depends on the user agent. Rendering may vary according to
   whether the user has already visited the link or not. A possible visual
   rendering of the previous link might be:

   one.". Usually, the contents of A are not rendered in any special way
   when A defines an anchor only.

   Having defined the anchor, we may link to it from the same or another
   document. URIs that designate anchors contain a "#" character followed
   by the anchor name (the fragment identifier). Here are some examples of
   such URIs:
     * An absolute URI: http://www.mycompany.com/one.html#anchor-one
     * A relative URI: ./one.html#anchor-one or one.html#anchor-one
     * When the link is defined in the same document: #anchor-one

   Thus, a link defined in the file "two.html" in the same directory as
   "one.html" would refer to the anchor as follows:
...text before the link...
For more information, please consult <A href="./one.html#anchor-one"> anchor one
</A>.
...text after the link...

   The A element in the following example specifies a link (with href) and
   creates a named anchor (with name) simultaneously:
I just returned from vacation! Here's a
<A name="anchor-two"
   href="http://www.somecompany.com/People/Ian/vacation/family.png">
photo of my family at the lake.</A>.

   This example contains a link to a different type of Web resource (a PNG
   image). Activating the link should cause the image resource to be
   retrieved from the Web (and possibly displayed if the system has been
   configured to do so).

   attribute values.

  12.2.2 Nested links are illegal

   Links and anchors defined by the A element must not be nested; an A
   element must not contain any other A elements.

   Since the DTD defines the LINK element to be empty, LINK elements may
   not be nested either.

  12.2.3 Anchors with the id attribute
--
       should still attempt to process it. It should alert the user and
       may allow the user to intervene and identify the document type.

12.3 Document relationships: the LINK element

<!ELEMENT LINK - O EMPTY               -- a media-independent link -->
<!ATTLIST LINK
  %attrs;                              -- %coreattrs, %i18n, %events --
  charset     %Charset;      #IMPLIED  -- char encoding of linked resource --
  href        %URI;          #IMPLIED  -- URI for linked resource --
  hreflang    %LanguageCode; #IMPLIED  -- language code --
  type        %ContentType;  #IMPLIED  -- advisory content type --
  rel         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- forward link types --
  rev         %LinkTypes;    #IMPLIED  -- reverse link types --
  media       %MediaDesc;    #IMPLIED  -- for rendering on these media --
  >

--

   This element defines a link. Unlike A, it may only appear in the HEAD
   section of a document, although it may appear any number of times.
   Although LINK has no content, it conveys relationship information that
   may be rendered by user agents in a variety of ways (e.g., a tool-bar
   with a drop-down menu of links).

   This example illustrates how several LINK definitions may appear in the
   HEAD section of a document. The current document is "Chapter2.html".
   The rel attribute specifies the relationship of the linked document
   with the current document. The values "Index", "Next", and "Prev" are
   explained in the section on link types.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN"
   "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
<HTML>
--
  12.3.1 Forward and reverse links

   The rel and rev attributes play complementary roles -- the rel
   attribute specifies a forward link and the rev attribute specifies a
   reverse link.

   Consider two documents A and B.
--

   Both attributes may be specified simultaneously.

  12.3.2 Links and external style sheets

   When the LINK element links an external style sheet to a document, the
   type attribute specifies the style sheet language and the media
   attribute specifies the intended rendering medium or media. User agents
   may save time by retrieving from the network only those style sheets
--

   Media types are further discussed in the section on style sheets.

  12.3.3 Links and search engines

   Authors may use the LINK element to provide a variety of information to
   search engines, including:
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, written in another human
       language.
     * Links to alternate versions of a document, designed for different
       media, for instance a version especially suited for printing.
     * Links to the starting page of a collection of documents.

   The examples below illustrate how language information, media types,
   and link types may be combined to improve document handling by search
   engines.

   In the following example, we use the hreflang attribute to tell search
   engines where to find Dutch, Portuguese, and Arabic versions of a
   document. Note the use of the charset attribute for the Arabic manual.
   Note also the use of the lang attribute to indicate that the value of
   the title attribute for the LINK element designating the French manual
   is in French.
<HEAD>
<TITLE>The manual in English</TITLE>
--
   Attributes defined elsewhere
     * target (target frame information)

   In HTML, links and references to external images, applets,
   form-processing programs, style sheets, etc. are always specified by a
   URI. Relative URIs are resolved according to a base URI, which may come
   from a variety of sources. The BASE element allows authors to specify a
--
   the definitions of these elements for more information about URI issues
   specific to them.

   Note. For versions of HTTP that define a Link header, user agents
   should handle these headers exactly as LINK elements in the document.
   HTTP 1.1 as defined by [RFC2616] does not include a Link header field
   (refer to section 19.6.3).
