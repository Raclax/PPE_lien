What is the difference between a physical link and a symbolic link?

   If you’re here is because you want to understand how links work, but
   before we understand it we must know how certain things work because it
   is an environment variable and how it differs from the other type of
   variables, also how the PAHT variable works, which has to do with the
   links in a script and that means the ASCII text within the text and how
   we make bash read it, well, actually there are many things.

   ENVIRONMENT VARIABLE:
--
   also environment variables, and because of this PAHT is the most
   important environment variable, if we change a small portion of the
   command path it stops working, PAHT saves the paths of “pwd , ls, mkdir
   “and many more, in other words, PHAT saves the LINKS of these commands
   inside an executable file.

   RELATIVE ROUTE:
--
   A script in LINUX is a file that contains different commands that are
   interpreted by the shell to execute them by means of its path or rather
   its LINK. The shell executes them as if it had written them in PROMPT.
   When we write a SCRIPT in a file we do it through a LINK called SHEBANG
   which gives the BASH path to read the script.

   ASCII:
--
   that is, it replaces letters with numbers which are interpreted by
   machines in a bit manner.

   I mention all this as a basis for understanding the links and their
   logical relationship of its operation, so let’s talk about links.

TO WHAT YOU HAVE COME TO!
--
   PAHT others to communicate or read directly as SHEBANG that places BASH
   to read the file.

   In Linux a link can be physical or symbolic:

   PHYSICAL LINK
   Physical links can only be created for files and not for directories,
   the PHYSICAL LINK is the name given to a file in another location which
   contains the path or information that is put to it.
   example:

   create a link from the current location;

   PROMPT ~$: home/ holbertonschool-low_level_programming

   WE CREATE A FILE ~$: emacs bettyCool

   WE CREATE THE LINK ~$: ln bettyCool holberton

   We put “ls” to see the content~$: ls; holberton

   There are two files, this means that if I enter holberton it will show
   me what has bettyCool, since both have the same content. And a
   characteristic of the PHYSICAL LINKS is that if you delete one of the
   two the other still exists without any problem.

   SYMBOLIC LINKS

   The symbolic links have the same function as a physical but the
   difference is that it does not contain the data of the file, instead it
   points to that folder or to the registry where the data is located. In
   other words it is like a shortcut in Windows that when I click it takes
   me to where the content I need, it would be like a kind of hyperlink of
   a web page. If the destination file is deleted the symbolic link will
   be unusable, because it will not be able to refer to the file it was
   pointing to, since it is not there.

   Symbolic links have the same syntax as the physical one but with a
   small only that we add the option -s to indicate that we want to make a
   symbolic link.
   Example:
--
   PROMPT ~$ : ls/home/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/

   we have files ~$: bettyCool
   We create the symbolic link from the current path and we create a new
   home file called ENIAC that points to the bettyCool path.

   Now we see that after creating the symbolic link we go to the home
   folder and with “ls -l” we will see that ENIAC points to the ROUTE of
   bettyCool, and if we enter ENIAC it shows me the content of bettyCool,
   this would be the same and practically a C pointer.

When you open files or directories very repeatedly, links are your best tool
to shorten time and eliminate headaches,
use them as you will look very professional in doing so.
Thank you and I hope this information helps you with Linux.
