     * Irrespective of what the database calls it, and notwithstanding
       that it may or may not be a "relation" in a certain sense, the end
       user's perspective is that the function of the button is to
       'establish a link' and therefore Link would be the right label for
       the button.

     * I think, link and relate are different even in daily English. So a
       native-English user would understand even if you use link. I prefer
       link cause relate is used to put items together into a relation (a
       table), right?

   Verbs that are commands are best when they don't require and object.

   The meaning of link as "connect or join up" does not require an object.

   The meaning of relate as "show a connection between" can take an
   object. It doesn't always have to, but as a stand alone word relate
