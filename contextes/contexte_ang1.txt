   A literature review found 27 studies looking at the effect of physical
   activity on brain function in people over 60 years of age. In 26 of the
   studies there was a clear link between physical activity levels and
   cognitive performance, suggesting that exercise might be an effective
   way to reduce cognitive decline in later life.</text>

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

<text>   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.

       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.

Creating an internet link

   You can add internet links to containers in Objective ECM. For example,
   during research on a team project you may have come across valuable
   information within a number of websites. You can add these website
   links to your team's folder.

   Internet links can be one of the following protocols:
     * http
     * https
     * mailto
     * ftp
     * a custom protocol.

Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

--
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom textHeading Text` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different sectionCross-References to Locations in
--

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:
--
Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text link URL`_

   For example:
`CNN http://cnn.com`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

--

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

--
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
   $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

--
Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
--
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.

text   In this topic, we continue our discussion of features found under the
   Misc command on the Tools Menu.

   The Internet Links menu command displays the Internet links for the
   person that is logged on to AIM. By clicking a link, the default Web
   browser, Internet Explorer or Firefox for example, will connect to the
   link via the Internet.

   In the steps that follow, we show you how to add and remove folders and
   links. With a little practice, you will be able to use the AIM Internet
   Links to quickly connect to your business related Internet links.
    1. On the Tools menu, point to Misc, and then click Internet Links.

    2. In the unlabeled box, you can type a Web address (URL) and then
       click the Go To button to open the URL in your default Web browser.
    3. In the list of Internet links, click or to expand and collapse
       folders containing Internet links.
    4. Double-click a link to open the link in your Web browser.
       Alternatively, you can single-click the link and the link will be
       displayed in the unlabeled text box so you can view it or click the
       Go To button.

    5. To modify the links and folders shown in the list, right-click in
       the list and choose from the available options.
         1. Update Link – save changes to the link properties entered in
            the unlabeled text box
         2. Add Folder – add a sub-folder to an existing folder by
            entering the folder name in the Description box, in Add New
            Item (leave URL box empty)
         3. Add Link – add a link to a folder by entering
              1. Description – link name or description
              2. URL – Web address
         4. Delete Item – delete the selected folder or link

   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing
--

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element anchor id="name" /"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive

   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (/a) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The a tag can also consist of various attributes such as the
--

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.
--
   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.
--

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class"link label/a

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          a href="https://example.com/"Example/a
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

--
   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   Have you ever noticed that certain words on the Web look a little bit
   different? Whenever you see a word or phrase thatʼs underlined in blue,
   itʼs probably a hyperlink, or link for short. You might already know
   how links work, even if youʼve never thought about them much before.
   For example, try clicking the link below.

   Hey, Iʼm a link! Click me!

   Links are used to navigate the Web. When you click a link, it will take
   you to a different webpage. In the example below, weʼre clicking a link
   to learn more about the Cape Hatteras National Seashore.
   using links to navigate Wikipedia.org

   When you hover over a Wikipedia link, a preview of the linked site
   appears to give you more information. It is important to note that most
   web browsers show the linkʼs URL in the bottom-left
   corner of the window.
   viewing the link preview

   You may also notice that your cursor changes into a hand icon whenever
   you hover over a link.
   viewing the cursor as a hand icon

   If you see this icon, it means youʼve found a link. Youʼll find other
   types of links this way too. For example, many websites actually use
   images as links, so you can just click the image to navigate to another
   page. In the example below, weʼre clicking the picture of a coffee mug
   to open a page with more information about it.
   clicking an image formatted as a link

   Links donʼt always go to another website. In some cases, they allow you
   to download a file. When you click a link like this, the file will be
   downloaded to your computer. In the example below, weʼre downloading an
   installation file for a new application.
   downloading a file from a link

   As you can see, links are an important part of using the Web. They
   allow you to navigate between different webpages, download files, and
   do a whole lot more.
