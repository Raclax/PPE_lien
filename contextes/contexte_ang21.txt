Data link layer, Ethernet and physical layer

Overview

   In the previous chapters, we learnt about the application layer and
   transport layer port communication, we also looked at the network layer
   and IPv4 addressing for remote delivery of packets. In this chapter we
   look at the data link layer and discuss how it prepares packets for
   transport over different types of media and physical network
   components, we will also look at some of the Ethernet concepts and
   finally look at the physical layer.

Data link layer

   The data link layer is the 2^nd layer in the OSI model. its function is
   to primarily prepare packets for transmission over the physical media.
   It also serves to control the flow of data that will traverse the
   physical media. The Data Link PDU is the Frame. The two main functions
   performed at this layer include.
     * Framing of packets received from the network layer
     * Control of how data is handled by the physical media through MAC

Protocols and services

   In the other layers, most of the protocols were defined by the RFCs.
   However, in the Data Link layer, the IEEE defines most of the
   protocols. We will discuss some of these protocols in chapters on
   switching.

   the OSI model, is responsible for transmitting the data over the
   different types of physical media that may be present.

   The frames that are received from the data link layer are converted
   into bits for transmission over the medium in this layer. Depending on
   the type of physical medium, the physical layer may represent the bits
   as either; light signals, electrical signals or waves for transmission
--
   As we have learnt earlier; by this stage in communication, the user
   data has undergone several processes; segmentation at the transport
   layer, packets in the network layer, encapsulation into frames at the
   data link layer and finally, the data is converted into one of the
   three forms that can be transmitted over the physical media;
   electrical, light signals or microwaves in the physical layer.

    2. Fiber
    3. Wireless

   Just like the data link layer, the standards in the data link layer are
   not defined under RFC, however, other standards do exist.

Data carrying capacity in the physical layer
--
   different layer 1 and layer 2 protocols, however, the format of the
   frame does not change.

   As we mentioned in the previous sections, the data link layer provides
   mechanisms for converting packets to frames while the physical layer
   converts frames to bits which are then transmitted over the physical
   media.

Summary

   In this chapter, we have looked at the data link layer and how
   communication at layer 2 occurs. We have also looked at the physical
   layer and sending of data over the physical medium as bits. We
   concluded with the Ethernet and looked at communication over a switch
