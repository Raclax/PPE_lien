Learn the Basics of Quality Link Building for SEO
     __________________________________________________________________

What Is Link Building? A Definition

   Link building, simply put, is the process of getting other websites to
   link back to your website. All marketers and business owners should be
   interested in building links to drive referral traffic and increase
   their site’s authority.

   Why build links? Google’s algorithms are complex and always evolving,
   but backlinks remain an important factor in how every search engine
   determines which sites rank for which keywords. Building links is one
   of the many tactics used in search engine optimization (SEO) because
   links are a signal to Google that your site is a quality resource
   worthy of citation. Therefore, sites with more backlinks tend to earn
   higher rankings.

   There’s a right way and a wrong way, however, to build links to your
   site. If you care about the long-term viability of your site and
   business, you should only engage in natural linkbuilding, meaning, the
   process of earning links rather than buying them or otherwise achieving
   them through manipulative tactics (sometimes known as black-hat SEO, a
   practice that can get your site essentially banned from the search
   results).

   That said, natural, organic link building is a difficult,
   time-consuming process. Not all links are created equal: A link from an
   authoratative website like the Wall Street Journal will have a greater
   impact on your rankings on the SERP than a link from a small or newly
   built website, but high-quality links are harder to come by.

   This guide will teach you how to build quality links that improve your
   organic rankings without violating Google guidelines.

   Remember, link building is imperative in achieving high organic search
   rankings.

Why Link Building Is Important for SEO

   Link building is important because it is a major factor in how Google
   ranks web pages. Google notes that:

   “In general, webmasters can improve the rank of their sites by
   increasing the number of high-quality sites that link to their pages.”

   Imagine that we own a site promoting wind turbine equipment that we
   sell. We’re competing with another wind turbine equipment manufacturer.
   One of the ranking factors Google will look at in determining how to
   rank our respective pages is link popularity.

   While the above example provides a general visual understanding of why
   link building is important, it’s very basic. It omits key factors such
   as:
     * The trust and authority of the linking pages.
     * The SEO and content optimization of the respective sites.

   The most important concept to understand is that, as Google says,
   you’re more likely to have your content rank higher for keywords you’re
   targeting if you can get external websites to link to your pages.

Simple Link Building Strategies: How To Get Other Sites to Link to You

   There are a number of link building strategies used to get external
   websites to link to yours:
     * Content Creation & Promotion – Create compelling, unique,
       high-quality content that people will naturally want to reference
       and link to, and tell people about it. You have to spread the word
       before you can expect anyone to find your content and link to it!
     * Reviews & Mentions – Put your product, service, or site in front of
       influencers in your industry, such as popular bloggers or people
       with a large social media following.
     * Links from Friends & Partners – Ask people you know and people you
       work with to link to your site. Remember that relevance matters;
       links from sites that are in the same general industry or niche as
       your site will have more value than links from random, unrelated
       sites.

   It can take a while to build a lot of links, but be patient, and
   remember that shortcuts like buying links are against Google’s
   guidelines and can be devastating for your SEO. Don’t take chances.

Build Links for Free with Internal Link Building

   There’s an easy, underrated way to build links to the pages you’re
   attempting to improve search engine rankings for. And it’s a method you
   have total control over: Internal link building.

   In attempting to get a Web page to rank, there are a few key factors to
   consider:
     * Anchor Text – One of the most important things search engines take
       into account in ranking a page is the actual text a linking page
       uses to talk about your content. So if someone links to our Good
       Guys Wind Turbine Parts site with the text “wind turbine parts”,
       that will help us to rank highly for that keyword phrase, whereas
       if they had simply used text like “Good Guys LLC” to link to our
       site, we wouldn’t enjoy the same ranking advantage for the phrase
       “wind turbine parts”.
     * Quality of the Linking Page – Another factor taken into account is
       the quality of the page that is sending the link; search engines
       allow links from high-quality, trusted pages to count more in
       boosting rankings than questionable pages and sites.
     * Page the Link is Aimed At – Many times, when people talk about your
       site they’ll link to the home page. This makes it difficult for
       individual pages to achieve high rankings (because it’s so
       difficult for them to generate their own link equity).

   These are all elements we can’t control in attempting to get other
   sites to link to us. We can, however, control all of these elements in
   linking to our own pages from our own content. We can:
     * Determine what anchor text to use.
     * Decide which page to point that anchor text at.
     * Ensure that the quality and content of the linking page is high
       (since it’s our page!).

   Building external links to your site is important, but in focusing more
   of your efforts on the optimization of these internal links you can
   build quality in-bound links with rich anchor text to the proper pages,
   which will provide you with an unparalelled ranking boost (for free!).

Internal Link Building Tools and Tips

   So how do you go about building these great internal links? Well, you
   can set up a system for interlinking your pages in a few easy steps:
     * Keyword Research for Link Building – First, you need to utilize a
       keyword research tool to have numerous keywords suggested to you
       that are both relevant and popular.
     * Assign Keywords to Content – Next, you have to group your keywords
       strategically, creating a search-friendly information architecture.
     * Link Pages Using Targeted Anchor Text – The final step is to apply
       your keyword research to intelligent inter-linking; you do this by
       linking to content using the keywords you’ve discovered.

Use Your Site Search

   This one’s pretty simple, and can be used for multiple purposes:
     * Finding pages on your site to link to a new page – When you create
       new content, you want to make sure you can search your site for
       mentions of similar keyword variations you might want to link to
       that page.
     * Finding a page that’s been created to link to – Your site may have
       multiple content authors. In this case, you may have a vague idea
       that a page about “wind turbine rotors” has been created, but you
       don’t know the page title or URL. In this case, you can either type
--
       rotors” into Google. This would return all of the pages containing
       that phrase that Google has indexed.

Create an Internal SEO Link Building Wire Frame

   To do this, you simply need to map the keywords you’d like to target to
   the most logical pages. So, let’s say we have three pages to choose

   something like this:
