   More complex arrangements exist, such as many-to-many links.

   The effect of following a hyperlink may vary with the hypertext system
   and may sometimes depend on the link itself; for instance, on the World
   Wide Web most hyperlinks cause the target document to replace the
   document being displayed, but some are marked to cause the target
   document to open in a new window (or, perhaps, in a new tab).^[2]
   Another possibility is transclusion, for which the link target is a
   document fragment that replaces the link anchor within the source
   document. Not only persons browsing the document may follow hyperlinks.
   These hyperlinks may also be followed automatically by programs. A
   program that traverses the hypertext, following each hyperlink and

Inline links

   An inline link displays remote content without the need for embedding
   the content. The remote content may be accessed with or without the
   user following the link.

   An inline link may display a modified version of the content; for
   instance, instead of an image, a thumbnail, low resolution preview,
   cropped section, or magnified section may be shown. The full content is
   then usually available on demand, as is the case with print publishing

Anchor links

   An anchor hyperlink (anchor link) is a link bound to a portion of a
   document,^[3] which is often called a fragment. The fragment is
   generally a portion of text or a heading, though not necessarily. For
   instance, it may also be a hot area in an image (image map in HTML), a
   designated, often irregular part of an image.

   Fragments are marked with anchors (in any of various ways), which is
   why a link to a fragment is called an anchor link (that is, a link to
   an anchor). For example, in XML, the element <anchor id="name" />"
   provides anchoring capability (as long as the DTD or schema defines
   it), and in wiki markup, {{anchor|name}} is a typical example of

   may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that
   country. A separate invisible hot area interface allows for swapping
   skins or labels within the linked hot areas without repetitive
   embedding of links in the various skin elements.

   Text hyperlink. Hyperlink is embedded into a word or a phrase and makes
   this text clickable.

Fat links

   A fat link (also known as a "one-to-many" link, an "extended link"^[5]
   or a "multi-tailed link")^[6] is a hyperlink which leads to multiple
   endpoints; the link is a set-valued function.

   Main article: HTML element § Anchor

   Tim Berners-Lee saw the possibility of using hyperlinks to link any
   information to any other information over the Internet. Hyperlinks were
   therefore integral to the creation of the World Wide Web. Web pages are
   written in the hypertext mark-up language HTML.
--
       many browsers display the target URL somewhere on the screen, such
       as in the lower left-hand corner.
     * Typically these words are underlined and colored (for example, blue
       for a link that has not yet been visited and purple for a link
       already visited).
     * The anchor closing tag (</a>) terminates the hyperlink code.
     * The <a> tag can also consist of various attributes such as the

   The W3C recommendation called XLink describes hyperlinks that offer a
   far greater degree of functionality than those offered in HTML. These
   extended links can be multidirectional, remove linking from, within,
   and between XML documents. It can also describe simple links, which are
   unidirectional and therefore offer no more functionality than
   hyperlinks in HTML.

   of lightweight markup languages specifically for wikis, provides a
   simplified syntax for linking pages within wiki environments – in other
   words, for creating wikilinks.
   Simple image demonstrating how internal RemveMediaWiki links work (that
   is, the order of the link's parts) when you want to create a link that
   displays words differently from the linked page's title: two opening
   square brackets, the ACTUAL link, a pipe character explained as the
   necessary divider, the words that are how I want it to APPEAR, and two
   closing square brackets. How internal MediaWiki links work when one
   wants to create a link that displays words different from the linked
   page's title.

   The syntax and appearance of wikilinks may vary. Ward Cunningham's
--
   is still used in some wikis, such as TiddlyWiki, Trac, and PmWiki. A
   common markup syntax is the use of double square brackets around the
   term to be wikilinked. For example, the input "[[zebras]]" is converted
   by wiki software using this markup syntax to a link to a zebras
   article. Hyperlinks used in wikis are commonly classified as follows:
     * Internal wikilinks or intrawiki links lead to pages within the same
       wiki website.
     * Interwiki links are simplified markup hyperlinks that lead to pages
       of other wikis that are associated with the first.
     * External links lead to other webpages (those not covered in the
       above two cases, wiki or not wiki).

   Wikilinks are visibly distinct from other text, and if an internal
   wikilink leads to a page that does not yet exist, it usually has a
   different specific visual appearance. For example, in Wikipedia
   wikilinks are displayed in blue, except those that link to pages that
   do not yet exist, which are instead shown in red.^[7] Another
   possibility for linking is to display a highlighted clickable question
   mark after the wikilinked term.

   Permalinks are URLs that are intended to remain unchanged for many
   years into the future, yielding hyperlinks that are less susceptible to
   link rot. Permalinks are often rendered simply, that is, as friendly
   URLs, so as to be easy for people to type and remember. Permalinks are
   used in order to point and redirect readers to the same Web page, blog
   post or any online digital media.^[10]

   The scientific literature is a place where link persistence is crucial
   to the public knowledge. A 2013 study in BMC Bioinformatics analyzed
   15,000 links in abstracts from Thomson Reuters' Web of Science citation
   index, founding that the median lifespan of Web pages was 9.3 years,
   and just 62% were archived.^[11] The median lifespan of a Web page
   constitutes high-degree variable, but its order of magnitude usually is

How hyperlinks work in HTML

   A link from one domain to another is said to be outbound from its
   source anchor and inbound to its target.

   The most common destination anchor is a URL used in the World Wide Web.
--

   A web browser usually displays a hyperlink in some distinguishing way,
   e.g. in a different color, font or style, or with certain symbols
   following to visualize link target or document types. This is also
   called link decoration. The behavior and style of links can be
   specified using the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) language.

   In a graphical user interface, the appearance of a mouse cursor may
   change into a hand motif to indicate a link. In most graphical web
   browsers, links are displayed in underlined blue text when they have
   not been visited, but underlined purple text when they have. When the
   user activates the link (e.g., by clicking on it with the mouse) the
   browser displays the link's target. If the target is not an HTML file,
   depending on the file type and on the browser and its plugins, another
   program may be activated to open the file.

   The HTML code contains some or all of the five main characteristics of
   a link:
     * link destination ("href" pointing to a URL)
     * link label
     * link title
     * link target
     * link class or link id

   It uses the HTML element "a" with the attribute "href" (HREF is an
   abbreviation for "Hypertext REFerence"^[13]) and optionally also the
--
          <a href="URL" title="link title" target="link target"
          class="link class">link label</a>

   To embed a link into a web page, blogpost, or comment, it may take this
   form:

          <a href="https://example.com/">Example</a>
--
   document.

   By default, browsers will usually display hyperlinks as such:
     * An unvisited link is usually blue and underlined
     * A visited link is usually purple and underlined
     * An active link is usually red and underlined

   When the cursor hovers over a link, depending on the browser and
   graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be
   shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box,
   which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears
   anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away
   and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all
   show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.

   Normally, a link opens in the current frame or window, but sites that
   use frames and multiple windows for navigation can add a special
   "target" attribute to specify where the link loads. If no window exists
   with that name, a new window is created with the ID, which can be used
   to refer to the window later in the browsing session.

   attribute. To prevent accidental reuse of a window, the special window
   names "_blank" and "_new" are usually available, and always cause a new
   window to be created. It is especially common to see this type of link
   when one large website links to an external page. The intention in that
   case is to ensure that the person browsing is aware that there is no
   endorsement of the site being linked to by the site that was linked
   from. However, the attribute is sometimes overused and can sometimes

   as HTML links). HTML's advantage was the ability to mix graphics, text,
   and hyperlinks, unlike Gopher, which just had menu-structured text and
   hyperlinks.
