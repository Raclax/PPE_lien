<font color="#000000">In sections 1.3 and 1.4 we have examined the roles
of end systems and routers in a network architecture.&nbsp; In this section
we consider the <b>access network</b> - the physical link(s) that connect
an end system to its <b>edge router</b>, i.e., the first router on a path
from the end system to any other distant end system..&nbsp; Since access
network technology is closely tied to physical media technology (fiber,
coaxial pair, twisted pair telephone wire, radio spectrum), we consider
these two topics together in this section.</font>

<br><b>Figure 1.5-1: </b>Access networks</center>
Access networks can be loosely divided into three categories:
<ul>
<li>
<b>residential access networks</b>, connecting a home end system into the
network;</li>

<li>
<b>institutional access networks</b>, connecting an end system in a business
or educational institution into the network;</li>

<li>
<b>mobile access networks</b>, connecting a mobile end system into the
network</li>
</ul>
These categories are not hard and fast; some corporate end systems may
well use the access network technology that we ascribe to residential access
networks, and vice versa.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our descriptions below are meant
to hold for the common (if not every) case.
<h3>
Residential Access Networks</h3>
A residential access network connects a home end system (typically a PC,
but perhaps a Web TV or other residential system) to an edge router. Probably
the most common form of home access is using a <b>modem</b> over a POTS
(plain old telephone system) dialup line to an Internet service provider
(ISP). The home modem converts the digital output of the PC into analog
format&nbsp; for transmission over the analog phone line.&nbsp; A modem
in the ISP converts the analog signal back into digital form for input
to the ISP router.&nbsp; In this case, the "access network" is simply a
point-to-point dialup link into an edge router.&nbsp; The point-to-point
link is your ordinary twisted-pair phone line. (We will discuss twisted
pair later in this section.) Today's modem speeds allow dialup access at
rates up to 56 Kbps.&nbsp; However, due to the poor quality of twisted-pair
line between many homes and ISPs, many users get an effective rate significantly
less than 56 Kbps.&nbsp; For an in depth discussion of the practical aspects
of modems see the Institute for Global Communications (IGC) web page on
<a href="http://www.igc.org/support4/modems.html">Modems
and Data Communications</a>.
<p>While dialup modems require conversion of the end system's digital data
into analog form for transmission, so-called narrowband<b> ISDN</b> technology
(Integrated Services Digital Network) [<a href="#[Pacific Bell 1998]">Pacific
Bell 1998</a>] allows for all-digital transmission of data from a home
end system over ISDN "telephone" lines to a phone company central office.&nbsp;
Although ISDN was originally conceived as a way to carry digital data from
one end of the phone system to another, it is also an important network
access technology that&nbsp; provides higher speed access (e.g., 128 Kbps)&nbsp;
from the home into a data network such as the Internet.&nbsp; In this case,
ISDN can be thought of simply as a "better modem" [<a href="#[NAS 1995]">NAS
1995</a>].&nbsp; A good source for additional WWW information on ISDN is
<a href="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~dank/isdn/">Dan
Kegel's ISDN page</a>.
<p>Dialup modems and narrowband ISDN are already widely deployed technologies.
Two new technologies, <b>Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL)</b>
[<a href="#[ADSL 1998]">ADSL 1998</a>] and <b>hybrid fiber coaxial cable
(HFC)</b> [<a href="#[Cable 1998]">Cable 1998</a>] are currently being
deployed.&nbsp; ADSL is conceptually similar to dialup modems: it is a
new modem technology again running over existing twisted pair telephone
lines, but can transmit at rates of up to about 8 Mbps from the ISP router
to a home end system.&nbsp; The data rate in the reverse direction, from
the home end system to the central office router, is less than 1 Mbps.&nbsp;
The asymmetry in the access speeds gives rise to the term "Asymmetric"
in ADSL.&nbsp; The asymmetry in the data rates reflects the belief that
home users are more likely to be a consumer of information (bringing data
into their homes) than a producer of information.
<p>ADSL uses frequency division multiplexing, as described in the previous
section. In particular, ADSL divides the communication link between the
home the ISP into three non-overlapping frequency bands:
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
a <b>high-speed downstream channel</b>, in the 50 KHz to 1 MHz band;</li>

<li>
a <b>medium-speed upstream channel</b>, in the 4 KHz to 50 KHz band;</li>

<li>
and an <b>ordinary POTs two-way telephone channel</b>, in the 0 to 4 KHz
band.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
One of the features of ADSL is that the service allows the user to make
an ordinary telephone call, using the POTs channel, while simultaneously
surfing the Web. This feature is not available with standard dailup modems.
The actually amount of downstream and upstream bandwidth available to the
user is a function of the distance between the home modem and the ISP modem,
the gauge of the twisted pair line, and the degree of electrical interference.
For a high-quality line with negligible electrical interference, an 8 Mbps
downstream transmission rate is possible if the distance between the home
and the ISP is less than 3,000 meters; the downstream transmission rate
drops to about 2 Mbps for a distance of 6,000 meters. The upstream rate
ranges from 16 Kbps to 1 Mbps.
<p>While ADSL, ISDN and dailup modems all use ordinary phone lines, HFC
access networks are extensions of the current cable network used for broadcasting
cable television.&nbsp; In a traditional cable system, a cable head end
station broadcasts through a distribution of coaxial cable and amplifiers
to residences. (We discuss coaxial cable later in this chapter.)&nbsp;
As illustrated in Figure 1.5-2,&nbsp; fiber optics (also to be discussed
soon) connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level junctions, from
which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach individual houses
and apartments. Each neighborhood juncture typically supports 500 to 5000
homes.
<center><img SRC="cable.jpg" VSPACE=10 height=487 width=720>
<br><b>Figure 1.5-2: </b>A hybrid fiber-coax access network</center>

<p>As with ADSL, HFC requires special modems, called <a href="http://CableDatacomNews.com/cmic1.htm">cable
modems</a>. Companies that provide cable Internet access require their
customers to either purchase or lease a modem. One such company is <a href="http://www.cybercable.fr/">CyberCable</a>,
which uses <a href="http://www.mot.com/MIMS/Multimedia/prod/specs/modemSpec.html">Motorola's
CyberSurfer Cable Modem</a> and provides high-speed Internet access to
most of the neighborhoods in Paris. Typically, the cable modem is an external
device and connects to the home PC through a 10-BaseT Ethernet port. (We
will discuss Ethernet in great detail in Chapter 5.)&nbsp; Cable modems
divide the HFC network into two channels, a downstream and an upstream
channel. As with ADSL, the downstream channel is typically allocated more
bandwidth and hence a larger transmission rate. For example, the downstream
rate of the CyberCable system is 10 Mbps and the upstream rate is 768 Kbps.
However, with HFC (and not with ADSL), these rates are shared among the
homes, as we discuss below.
<p>One important characteristic of the HFC is that it is a shared broadcast
medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend travels downstream
on every link to every home; and every packet sent by a home travels on
the upstream channel to the headend. For this reason, if several users
are receiving different Internet videos on the downstream channel, actual
rate at which each user receives its video will be significantly less than
downstream rate. On the other hand, if all the active users are Web surfing,
then each of the users may actually receive Web pages at the full downstream
rate, as a small collection of users will rarely receive a Web page at
exactly the same time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, packets
sent by two different homes at the same time will collide, which further
decreases the effective upstream bandwidth. (We will discuss this collision
issue in some detail when we discuss Ethernet in Chapter 5.) Advocates
of ADSL are quick to point out that ADSL is a point-to-point connection
between the home and ISP, and therefore all the ADSL bandwidth is dedicated
rather than shared. Cable advocates, however, argue that a reasonably dimensioned
HFC network provides higher bandwidths than ADSL [<a href="#[@Home 1998]">@Home
1998</a>].&nbsp; The battle between ADSL and HFC for high speed residential
access has clearly begun, e.g., [<a href="#[@Home 1998]">@Home 1998</a>].
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Enterprise Access Networks</h3>
&nbsp;In enterprise access networks, a local area network (LAN) is used
to connect an end system to an edge router.&nbsp;&nbsp; As we will see
in Chapter 5, there are many different types of LAN technology.&nbsp; However,&nbsp;
Ethernet technology is currently by far the most prevalent access technology
in enterprise networks. Ethernet operates 10 Mbps or 100Mbps (and now even
at 1 Gbps). It uses either twisted-pair copper wire are coaxial cable to
connect&nbsp; a number of end systems with each other and with an edge
router.&nbsp; The edge router is responsible for routing packets that have
destinations outside of that LAN.&nbsp; Like HFC, Ethernet uses a shared
medium, so that end users share the the transmission rate of the LAN.&nbsp;
More recently, shared Ethernet technology has been migrating towards switched
Ethernet technology.&nbsp; Switched Ethernet uses multiple coaxial cable
or twisted pair Ethernet segments connected at a "switch"&nbsp; to allow
the full bandwidth an Ethernet to be delivered to different users on the
same LAN simultaneously [<a href="#[Cisco 1998]">Cisco 1998</a>]. We will
explore shared and switched Ethernet in some detail in Chapter 5.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Mobile Access Networks</h3>
Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum to connect a mobile end system
(e.g., a laptop PC or a PDA with a wireless modem) to a base station, as
shown in Figure 1.5-1.&nbsp; This base station, in turn, is connected to
an edge router of a data network.
<p>An emerging standard for wireless data networking is Cellular Digital
Packet Data (CDPD) [<a href="#[Wireless 1998]">Wireless 1998</a>].&nbsp;
As the name suggests, a CDPD network operates as an overlay network (i.e.,
as a separate, smaller "virtual" network, as a piece of the larger network)
within the cellular telephone network.&nbsp; A CDPD network thus uses the
same radio spectrum as the cellular phone system, and operates at speeds
in the 10's of Kbits per second.&nbsp; As with cable-based access networks
and shared Ethernet, CDPD end systems must share the transmission media
with other CDPD end systems within the cell covered by a base station.&nbsp;
A media access control (MAC) protocol is used to arbitrate channel sharing
among the CDPD end systems; we will cover MAC protocols in detail in Chapter
5.
<p>The CDPD system supports the IP protocol, and thus allows an IP end
system to exchange IP packets over the wireless channel with an IP base
station.&nbsp; A CDPD network can actually support multiple network layer
protocols; in addition to IP, the ISO CNLP protocol is also supported.
CDPD does not provide for any protocols above the network layer.&nbsp;
From an Internet perspective, CDPD can be viewed as extending the Internet
dialtone (i.e., the ability to transfer IP packets) across a wireless link
between a mobile end system and an Internet router. An excellent introduction
to CDPD is [<a href="#[Waung 1998]">Waung 98].</a>
<h3>
<font color="#000000"><font size=+2>1.5.2 Physical Media</font></font></h3>
<font size=+0>In the previous subsection we gave an overview of some of
the most important access network technologies in the Internet. While describing
these technologies, we also indicated the physical media used. For example,
we said that HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial cable. We
said that ordinary modems, ISDN, and ADSL use twisted-pair copper wire.
And we said that&nbsp; mobile access network use the radio spectrum. In
this subsection we provide a brief overview of these and other transmission
media that are commonly employed in the Internet.</font>
<p><font size=+0>In order to define what is meant by a "physical medium,",
let us reflect on the brief life of a bit.</font> Consider a bit traveling
from one end system, through a series of links and routers, to another
end system. This poor bit gets transmitted many, many times! The source
end-system first transmits the bit and shortly thereafter the first router
in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits the bit
and shortly afterwards the second router receives the bit, etc. Thus our
bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series
of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver pair, the
bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves across a <b>physical medium</b>.
The physical medium can take many shapes and forms, and does not have to
be of the same type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path.
Examples of physical media include twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable,
multimode fiber optic cable, terrestrial radio spectrum and satellite radio
spectrum. Physical media fall into two categories: <b>guided media</b>
and <b>unguided media</b>. With guided media, the waves are guided along
a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a twisted-pair cooper wire
or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the waves propagate in the atmosphere
and in outer space, such as in a digital satellite channel or in a CDPD
system.
<h3>
Some Popular Physical Media</h3>
Suppose you want to wire a building to allow computers to access the Internet
or an intranet -- should you use twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable,
or fiber optics? Which of these media gives the highest bit rates over
the longest distances? We shall address these questions below.
<p>But before we get into the characteristics of the various guided medium
types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the
physical link (copper wire, fiber optic cable, etc.) is often relatively
minor compared with the other networking costs. In particular, the labor
cost associated with the installation of the physical link can be orders
of magnitude higher than the cost of the material. For this reason, many
builders install twisted pair, optical fiber, and coaxial cable to every
room in a building. Even if only one medium is initially used, there is
a good chance that another medium could be used in the near future, and
so money is saved but not having to lay additional wires.
<p><b><i>Twisted-Pair Copper Wire</i></b>
<p>The least-expensive and most commonly-used transmission medium is twisted-pair
copper wire. For <a href="http://www.att.com/agbell/">over one-hundred
years it has been used by telephone networks</a>. In fact, more than 99%
of the wired connections from the telephone handset to the local telephone
switch use twisted-pair copper wire. Most of us have seen twisted pair
in our homes and work environments. Twisted pair consists of two insulated
copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral pattern;
see Figure 1.5-3.&nbsp; The wires are twisted together to reduce the electrical
interference from similar pairs close by.&nbsp; Typically, a number of
pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs in a protective
shield. A wire pair constitutes a single communication link.
<center><img SRC="grentwist.gif" VSPACE=10 height=30 width=332>
<br><b>Figure 1.5-3:</b> Twisted Pair</center>

<p><b>Unshielded twisted pair (UTP)</b> is commonly used for computer networks
within a building, that is, for local area networks (LANs). Data rates
for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. The data
rates that can be achieved depend on the thickness of the wire and the
distance between transmitter and receiver. Two types of UTP are common
in LANs: category 3 and category 5. Category 3 corresponds to voice-grade
twisted pair, commonly found in office buildings. Office buildings are
often prewired with two or more parallel pairs of category 3 twisted pair;
one pair is used for telephone communication, and the additional pairs
can be used for additional telephone lines or for LAN networking. 10 Mbps
Ethernet, one of the most prevalent LAN types, can use category 3 UTP.
Category 5, with its more twists per centimeter and Teflon insulation,
can handle higher bit rates. 100 Mbps Ethernet running on category 5 UTP
has become very popular&nbsp; in recent years. In recent years, category
5 UTP has become common for preinstallation in new office buildings.
<p>When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people disparaged
twisted-pair&nbsp; because of its relatively low bit rates. Some people
even felt that fiber optic technology would completely replace twisted
pair. But twisted pair did not give up so easily. <a href="http://www.rwdata.co.uk/proced.htm">Modern
twisted-pair technology</a>, such as category 5 UTP, can achieve data rates
of 100 Mbps for distances up to a few hundred meters. Even higher rates
are possible over shorter distances. In the end, twisted-pair has emerged
as the dominant&nbsp; solution for high-speed LAN networking.
<p>As discussed in Section 1.5.1, twisted-pair is also commonly used for
residential Internet access. We saw that dial-up modem technology enables
access at rates of up to 56 Kbps over twisted pair. We also saw that
<a href="http://www.pacbell.com/products/business/fastrak/networking/isdn/info/isdn-overview/index.html">ISDN</a>
is available in many communities, providing access rates of about 128 Kbps
over twisted pair. We also saw that <a href="http://www.adsl.com/adsl_tutorial.html">ADSL</a>
(Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Loop) technology has enabled residential
users to access the Web at rates in excess of 6 Mbps over twisted pair.
<p><b><i>Coaxial-Cable</i></b>
<p>Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors,
but the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this construction
and a special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable can have higher bit
rates than twisted pair. Coaxial cable comes in two varieties: <b>baseband
coaxial cable</b> and <b>broadband coaxial cable</b>.
<p>Baseband coaxial cable, also called 50-ohm cable, is about a centimeter
thick, lightweight, and easy to bend. It is&nbsp; commonly used in LANs;
in fact, the computer you use at work or at school is probably connected
to a LAN with either baseband coaxial cable or with UTP. Take a look at
the the connection to your computer's interface card. If you see a telephone-like
jack and some wire that resembles telephone wire, you are using UTP; if
you see a T-connector and a cable running out of both sides of the T-connector,
you are using baseband coaxial cable. The terminology "baseband" comes
from the fact that the stream of bits is dumped directly into the cable,
without shifting the signal to a different frequency band. 10 Mbps Ethernets
can use either UTP or baseband coaxial cable. As we will discuss in the
Chapter 5, it is a little more expensive to use UTP for 10 Mbps Ethernet,
as UTP requires an additional networking device, called a <b>hub</b>.
<p>Broadband coaxial cable, also called 75-ohm cable, is quite a bit thicker,
heavier, and stiffer than the baseband variety. It was once commonly used
in LANs and can still be found in some older installations. For LANs, baseband
cable is now preferable, since it is less expensive, easier to physically
handle, and does not require attachment cables. Broadband cable, however,
is quite common in cable television systems. As we saw in Section 1.5.1,
cable television systems have been recently been coupled with <a href="http://CableDatacomNews.com/cmic1.htm">cable
modems</a> to provide residential users with Web access at rates of 10
Mbps or higher. With broadband coaxial cable, the transmitter shifts the
digital signal to a specific frequency band, and the resulting analog signal
is sent from the transmitter to one or more receivers. Both baseband and
broadband coaxial cable can be used as a guided <b>shared medium</b>. Specifically,
a number of end systems can be connected directly to the cable, and all
the end systems receive whatever any one of the computers transmits. We
will look at this issue in more detail in Chapter 5.
<p><b><i>Fiber Optics</i></b>
<p>An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of
light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber can support
tremendous bit rates, up to tens or even hundreds of gigabits per second.
They are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very low signal attenuation
up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap. These characteristics have
made fiber optics the preferred long-haul guided transmission media, particularly
for overseas links. Many of the long-distance telephone networks in the
United States and elsewhere now use fiber optics exclusively. Fiber optics
is also prevalent in the backbone of the Internet. However, the high cost
of optical devices -- such as transmitters, receivers, and switches --
has hindered their deployment for short-haul transport, such as in a LAN
or into the home in a residential access network. AT&amp;T Labs provides
an <a href="http://www.att.com/attlabs/brainspin/fiberoptics/">excellent
site on fiber optics</a>, including several nice animations.
<p><b><i>Terrestrial and Satellite Radio Channels</i></b>
<p>Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum.&nbsp;
They are an attractive media because require no physical "wire" to be installed,
can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can potentially
carry a signal for long distances. The characteristics a radio channel
depend significantly on the propagation environment and the distance over
which a signal is to be carried. Environmental considerations determine
path loss and shadow fading (which decrease in signal strength as it travels
over a distance and around/through obstructing objects), multipath fading
(due to signal reflection off of interfering objects),&nbsp; and interference
(due to other radio channels or electromagnetic signals).
<p>Terrestrial radio channels can be broadly classified into two groups:
those that operate as local area networks (typically spanning 10's to a
few hundred meters) and wide-area radio channels that are used for mobile
data services (typically operating within a metropolitan region).&nbsp;
A number of wireless LAN products are on the market, operating in the 1
to 10's of Mbps range. Mobile data services (such as the CDPD standard
we touched on in section 1.3), typically provide&nbsp; channels that operate
at 10's of Kbps.&nbsp; See&nbsp; [<a href="#[Goodman 1997]">Goodman 97</a>]
for a survey and discussion of the technology and products.
<p>A communication satellite links two or more earth-based microwave transmitter/receivers,
known as ground stations. The satellite receives transmissions on one frequency
band, regenerates the signal using a repeater (discussed below), and transmits
the signal on another frequency. Satellites can provide bandwidths in the
gigabit per second range. Two types of satellites are used in communications:
geostationary satellites and low-altitude satellites.
<p>Geostationary satellites permanently remain above the same spot on the
Earth. This stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in
orbit at 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This huge distance
between from ground station though satellite back to ground station introduces
a substantial signal propagation delay of 250 milliseconds. Nevertheless,
satellites links are often used in telephone networks and in the backbone
of the Internet.
<p>Low-altitude satellites are placed much closer to the Earth and do not
remain permanently above one spot on the Earth. They rotate around the
Earth just as the Moon rotates around the Earth. To provide continuous
coverage to an area, many satellites to be placed in orbit. There are currently
many low-altitude communication systems in development. The <a href="http://www.iridium.com">Iridium
system</a>, for example, consists of 66 low-altitude satellites. <a href="http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/constellations/iridium.html">Lloyd's
satellite constellations</a> provides and collects information on Iridium
as well as other satellite constellation systems. The low-altitude satellite
technology may be used for Internet access sometime in the future.
