Creating an internet link

   You can add internet links to containers in Objective ECM. For example,
   during research on a team project you may have come across valuable
   information within a number of websites. You can add these website
   links to your team's folder.

   Internet links can be one of the following protocols:
     * http
     * https
     * mailto
     * ftp
     * a custom protocol.

   How to add an internet link Closed
    1. Find or go to the location where you wish to create the internet
       link.
    2. Select the Action button, then Create object .
       The Choose a type to create blade displays to the right of the
       Content pane.
    3. Select Internet link.
    4. Enter a Name for the internet link.
    5. If you would like to create the internet link in a different
       container other than your Handy folder, select magnify or choose a
       recently used Container from the drop-down list
       On the Change container dialog box, there are a number of browse
       options for you to choose from to select a different container:
          + On the Recent tab, select a container from the list of ones
            you have recently accessed, then Use selected.
          + On the Handy tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Handy, select a container, then Use selected.
          + On the Home tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Objective Home folder to find and select the container you
            want. Then choose Use selected.
            Object aliases will not be displayed on the Home tab.
          + On the Global tab, use the Navigation pane to browse your
            Objective Global folder to find and select the container you
            want. Then choose Use selected.
          + On the Find tab, select the object type from the drop-down and
            enter your search criteria in the adjacent textbox. Select
            Find to display the search results. If you have multiple
            containers with the same name, you can select the Down arrow
            to view the container's hierarchy.
            Choose a container from the results list, then Use selected.
            You can also select a container in the search results and
            navigate to it, where you can select it's sub-folders or any
            other folder.
            The Selected field of the Change container dialog box lists
            your chosen container.
       Or you can simply drag-and-drop another container from your Content
       pane into the Selected container section of the Create folder
       blade.
       An error message displays if the selected container is not
       appropriate or you don’t have the appropriate permissions to use
       it.

    6. Select an object sub-Type from the drop-down list.
       By default the type is internet link.
    7. Enter or copy and paste the URL for the internet link.
    8. Optionally enter a Description for the internet link you are
       creating.

    9. Expand the Security settings section:
         1. Select a Security Classification from the drop-down list.
            You can only select options in the Security settings section
            if you have permission to do so and the section is visible.
            Security classifications can be used to configure the
            available access levels to stored data. Each user also has a
            Highest Available Classification assigned to them, which
            allows them to view objects of certain security
            classifications. This means that when you have set an object's
            security classification, any user with a Highest Available
            Classification equal to or higher than that object's security
            classification, is able to see it.
            Tick the Use inherited classification checkbox to use the
            listed classifications that are already part of the target /
            parent container.
         2. Select Caveats from the drop-down lists.
            Caveats are used in your organisation to secure information
            relating to an area of practice or specific knowledge level.
            If your administrator has set up caveats to be visible to all
            users, you will be able to assign caveats to objects that have
            been assigned to you or a specific caveat group. You must also
            have the appropriate user privileges to assign 'inactive'
            caveats (those that are no longer in use) where necessary.
            You can Find a caveat by entering the Name of the caveat then
            selecting Find. Choose the appropriate caveat from the search
            results, then Use selected.
            Tick the Use inherited caveats checkbox to use the listed
            caveats that are already part of the target / parent
            container.
   10. Expand Add fields to select a catalogue from the drop-down list.
       Depending on the catalogue selected, you may have other choices to
       make.
       Keyword fields
       For some object types, you will need to choose the appropriate
       keyword library to use. Your organisation may have created a custom
       keyword thesaurus to enable the classification and retrieval of
       records. Assigning keywords to an object will enable faster
       retrieval in searches and queries.
       All objects in Objective ECM (except for keywords) can use
       keywords.
       Keywords are grouped in the list by keyword library.
          + Select the appropriate keyword library from the User Catalogue
            drop-down list.
          + Either, select a keyword from the list or Find a keyword.
            Enter your keyword search criteria in the Name field. If you
            do not select Show non-preferred, only frequently used terms
            will be displayed in the search results.
       Select the appropriate keyword usage from the search results.
       Note:   In Objective Navigator, your Objective administrator must
       have already added keywords to the keyword library and defined them
       as being able to be assigned to objects, before you can include
       them with your objects.
       Fields from other applications
       If your catalogue fields are mapped to another application, you can
       search and select field values from that application. For more
       information, see Searching and selecting catalogue field values
       from third-party applications.
   11. Enter information into the other fields as appropriate.
   12. Select Create.
       Tip:  Select Back at any time to create a different object type if
       needed.
