Add Links¶

   You can include links to other locations in the same document, to
   locations in other documents and to external websites.

   For more information about creating links using reStructured Text and
   Sphinx, see Sphinx Hyperlinks.

Links to Sections in the Same Document¶

   You can link from text to a heading in any other part of the document
   by using the :ref: command with the heading text as the parameter. For
   example, this text in another part of this document would link to this
   section:
:ref:`Cross-References to Locations in the Same Document`

   Note

   Make sure you have sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel in your extensions in
   your conf.py file. For example, extensions =
   ['sphinx.ext.autosectionlabel']

   The heading text is printed as the link text.

Use Custom Link Text¶

   For internal links that use text other than the heading for the section
   that you’re linking to, use :ref:`custom text<Heading Text>` syntax, as
   in the following example.
Learn how to :ref:`link to a different section<Cross-References to Locations in
the Same Document>`.

   Note

   Do not include a space between the last word of the link text and the
   opening angle bracket for the anchor text.

   In this example, link to a different section is the link text, and
   Cross- References to Locations in the Same Document is the heading
   text.

Use a Custom Anchor¶

   When you have two sections with the same title in a project, you will
   get build errors when you have a link to either section, because Sphinx
   does not know which section to link to.

   In this case, you can create a custom anchor directly above the title
   and link to it, instead of the title itself. For example, if you have a
   section called Overview in each part of your document, you should add a
   more specific anchor above the section heading.
.. _RST Overview:

Overview
**********

RST Overview content


.. _Sphinx Overview:

Overview
*********

Sphinx Overview content

   In a :ref: command, you then use the anchor text. For example:
This is a link to the RST Overview: :ref:`RST Overview`

This is a link to the Sphinx Overview: :ref:`Sphinx Overview`

   In both cases, the link text is the section title, Overview, unless you
   Use Custom Link Text.

Links to External Web Pages¶

   To link to an external web page, use the following syntax:
`Link text <link URL>`_

   For example:
`CNN <http://cnn.com>`_

   You can also separate the link and the target definition. For example:
Get the latest news at `CNN`_.

.. _CNN: http://cnn.com/

Use the External Links Extension¶

   Managing links in large projects with multiple writers can get
   complicated. You want to avoid having multiple definitions for the same
   link.

   For such cases, try using the External Links Extension.

   With this extension, links to external web pages are stored in a
   top-level folder. Each link is stored in its own .py file.

   The following example shows the structure of the link definition in a
   .py file (for the External Links Extension link):
import link

link_name = "Sphinx External Links"
user_text = "External Links Extension"
url = "http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/extlinks.html"

link.xref_links.update({link_name: (user_text, url)})

   You then reference a link within content with the :xref role and the
   link name. For example:
:xref:`Sphinx External Links`

   The user text is displayed and links to the URL.

   Before you create a link, check if the link already exists in the
   project. Reuse an already-defined link when possible.

Setup External Links¶

   To set up the external links extension, take the following steps.

   (You can also copy the setup of the project for this document on
   GitHub.)
    1. Create a folder in your source folder called links.
    2. Add a file called __init__.py to the links folder, with the
       following content:
from os.path import dirname, basename, isfile

import glob
modules = glob.glob(dirname(__file__)+"/*.py")

__all__ = [ basename(f)[:-3] for f in modules if isfile(f)]

    3. Add a file called link.py to the links folder, with the following
       content:
xref_links = {"key" : ("link text", "URL")}

    4. In the project conf.py file, add the following lines:
import sys, os
sys.path.append('.')
from links.link import *
from links import *

   Then save any link definition files in the links folder and reference
   with :xref:`link_name`.

Add Link Make Command¶

   You can manually create and save new link files. You could also add a
   command to the project make file, to make it fast and easy to add new
   link definitions.

   For example, the following additions to the Makefile enable you to
   create a link from the command line (without error checking):
LINKSDIR       = source/links
.PHONY: link
link:
  @read -p "Enter a Unique Link Name: " link_name; \
  read -p "Enter the link text the user sees: " link_text; \
  read -p "Enter the URL: " link_url; \
  read -p "Enter the .py file name (use_lower_case_and_underscore of link name):
 " file_name; \
  echo "The link name is: " $$link_name; \
  echo "The link text is: " $$link_text; \
  echo "The URL is: " $$link_url; \
  echo "Creating the file: " $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py"; \
  echo "Enter the link in content as :xref:\`"$$link_name"\`"; \
  echo "The user will see:" $$link_text; \
  echo "Make sure you build and test the link."; \
  echo "import link\n\nen_us_user_text = \"$$link_text\" \n\n\
links.xref_links.update({\"$$link_name\": (en_us_user_text, \"$$link_url\")})" \
  > $(LINKSDIR)/$$file_name".py" \

   You can then create a link using the make link command from any
   project. You are prompted to enter the:
     * Link key
     * Link text
     * URL
     * Python file name

   You could also add a Sublime snippet for new links.

Test External Links¶

   You can use the built-in Sphinx command, checklinks to test all
   external links in your document. The command checks that a working web
   page is accessed at the given URL and reports any errors.

   Add the following code to the project Makefile:
LINKCHECKDIR  = build/linkcheck

.PHONY: checklinks
  checklinks:
  $(SPHINXBUILD) -b linkcheck $(ALLSPHINXOPTS) $(LINKCHECKDIR)
  @echo
  @echo "Check finished. Report is in $(LINKCHECKDIR)."

   Then, from the command window, enter:
make checklinks

   Sphinx compiles the document and tests all links. It shows the results
   in the command window, and writes results to the file output.txt in the
   build directory.

   For example, the following results show one link error.
   Link test results.
