7 powerful SEO link building strategies

How to get backlinks that will boost your search rankings and help you build
your brand.

   By Aleh Barysevich · July 14, 2021

   Backlinks are an important part of any SEO strategy, but they're not a
   set-it-and-forget-it kind of win. Backlinks can disappear, become
   toxic, or just become less relevant as time goes by. That means you
   have to continue to find new backlink opportunities to keep your search
   ranking high.

   I spend all my working hours thinking about SEO and helping people
   improve theirs, so I've learned a lot of creative strategies for
   getting backlinks. Here are the seven I recommend the most.

1. Replicate your competitors' SEO backlinks

   Automate your marketing
   Streamline your processes, minimize recurring tasks, and increase ROI.

   Figuring out who's linking to your competitors is a huge win.
   Competitor backlinks will almost certainly be on sites that are
   relevant to your niche, so you know they'd be quality backlinks for
   SEO.

   This could be a massive manual project, but there are tools (free and
   paid) that help you analyze the backlink profiles of your competitors.
   I'll use my free tool, Online Backlink Checker (part of
   Link-Assistant.com
   ), as an example, but the process would be pretty similar for any other
   software.

   All you need to do is open the tool, enter the competitor's URL, and
   click Check backlinks. The tool will audit the domain and generate a
   backlink profile, including the number of backlinks, the percent of
   dofollow backlinks, and historical data. Here's what that might look
   like.

   Scroll down, and you'll see the actual list of backlinks. To get the
   most powerful prospects, you can filter the results by Page InLink Rank
   and Dofollow.

   Take a look through the backlink pages, pick the most powerful
   opportunities, and then reach out to those sites to see if they'd be
   willing to link to your site. Just one thing: before you reach out,
   check to see if you already have a backlink from those providers—if you
   do, acknowledge that before asking for another.

2. Use the broken link building strategy

   Broken link building is the process of finding backlinks that lead to
   404 pages on other sites, contacting those sites, and suggesting they
   replace the 404 link with the one leading to a similar page on your
   website. It's a great way to get backlinks while also offering value to
   the site giving you the backlink.

   There are two primary ways to find these broken backlinks:

Find broken backlinks from your competitors

   You can use a backlink analysis tool (mine is called SEO SpyGlass) to
   do this kind of analysis. You'll be able to filter results to find
   high-authority dofollow backlinks that are throwing a 404 error.

   These backlink providers are now your prospects. Visit the page the
   broken link comes from, see if you have a relevant page to replace it
   with, and if so, reach out to suggest the replacement. If it truly is
   relevant, they might use your link because it helps them eliminate a
   404 without having to take the time to find a good replacement.

Analyze the website you want backlinks from

   If there's a specific site you want backlinks from, you can analyze it
   to see if it has any relevant broken links. In my tool, WebSite
   Auditor, this information is presented in the Site Structure > Site
   Audit > Links > Broken links module.
   Analyzing broken links for a specific site

   Once again, if you have a relevant replacement, offer it up to the site
   owner. If you think it would be a valuable enough backlink, you could
   even create new content that you then offer them—but keep in mind that
   there's no guarantee the effort you put in will be rewarded.

   One last thing: be transparent with the people you're reaching out to.
   Don't make it sound like you're just trying to help them—be clear that
   the link you're suggesting they use is from your website, and that you
   think it would be a relevant replacement. The person making the
   decision is a real human who will see right through you if you try to
   hide that.

3. Try to regain missing backlinks

   In addition to getting new backlinks, it's also worth spending time
   figuring out which of your previous backlinks are broken or have gone
   missing. In SEO SpyGlass, you'd go to Backlink profile > Backlinks and
   update the Backlink Page Info for your website.

   The tool will recrawl the selected pages and tell you if some links got
   lost.

   If you're using Ahrefs, another great tool, you can view the site's
   lost backlinks under Site Explorer > Backlink Profile > Backlinks >
   Lost:
   The number of missing backlinks in SEO SpyGlass

   There are plenty of reasons your links may have disappeared:
     * The link may have been replaced by the site owner (link is
       missing).
     * The backlink page may be gone (page not found).
     * The website may be down at the moment (site is down).
     * The page may be restricted from indexing.

   To restore a missing backlink, you'll need to contact the site owners
   and ask them for assistance. Depending on what the problem is, you
   might ask them to place your link on another page if the previous one
   has been removed, restore the backlink if it was deleted, or remove the
   noindex directives from their pages.

4. Build links with images

   Images grab attention and take up space, so it makes sense that people
   click on them. This is why it's worth creating images (infographics,
   graphics, product photos, comics, you name it) and promoting them to
   attract more backlinks.

   But if you use images as backlinks, you want to be sure that the link
   points to the broader page the image lives on, not to the image
   directory. Image directory links (ending in .gif, .png, .jpg, etc.) are
   dead-end: all the traffic that goes there is just wasted.

   To see if any of your backlinks lead to image directories, set up
   filters in your SEO tool to see if any target URLs contain images
   formats.
   Searching for image directories

   If you find any, ask the site owner to replace the link with the one
   that leads to the page with the image. If you're letting them embed
   your image on their site, they should be ok linking to the right place.

   In fact, you can even do a Google Images search to see if anyone is
   using your images. If the site is credible and you're ok with them
   keeping it there, you can ask them to add a link. (If it's a sketchy
   site, it's worth asking them to take it down.)

5. Write guest posts

   Guest posting will boost your credibility and get your brand in front
   of a new audience, but if you can include a link to your website within
   the content, it's also a great SEO strategy. Take a look at this
   article on how to guest post for SEO for more details about how to find
   the right opportunities and get your guest posts published.

6. Get on "best of" lists

   Getting on "best of" lists is of course a great validation of your
   product or service, but it also puts a link to your site on a relevant,
   authoritative site.

   To find the lists you might be a fit for, use a tool like Online
   Backlink Checker to check a competitor's website, and pay special
   attention to the dofollow backlinks that contain phrases like "best"
   and "top."
   Searching for best of lists on Online Backlink Checker

   You can contact the writer or site owner and ask about the process of
   getting added to the list. Sometimes it's paid placement, and other
   times it's up to editorial discretion, but sometimes if you provide
   them with a convincing blurb, they might put you on there to keep their
   content fresh.

7. Connect with other industry experts

   Engaging with other people in your industry—whether that's through
   events, social media, or other networking—can help get your site and
   content in front of more people who might end up linking back to you.

   For example, consider joining some relevant Facebook Groups: start
   conversations, join discussions, and share your relevant links. Don't
   overdo it; otherwise, you may (accurately!) come off as spammy. The
   goal here is to share information you think will be helpful for the
   people in the community. They can choose to do with it what they
   want—and if you're lucky, they might want to link to you.

   If you join an online community, pay attention to what other community
   members post. If someone says they're going to write a blog post about
   a topic related to your business, offer to chat with them and see what
   might come from it.
