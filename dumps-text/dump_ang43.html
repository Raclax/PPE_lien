Everything You Need To Know About ‘App Links’: The Mobile App URLs Equivalent
Of Website URLs

   Updated on October 24, 2017
   Everything You Need To Know About App Links

   Mobile App Links are a type of mobile URLs. They make it possible to
   link to specific pages or screens of an app. They also allow you to
   link your website pages to the respective screens in your app.

What do App Links do?


    They close the loop between the creation of content, its discovery
    and app downloads by creating unique links for different pages or
    screens of an app. Thus, App Links allow users to click links to view
    content directly in the app (if already downloaded), or download the
    app to view content present on any particular screen of the app.

Is it possible to type them like URLs in the address bar?

   Nopes, you can only share the mobile App URLs with others. Since there
   is no such thing as an address bar for apps, it is not possible to type
   App Links in the address bar.

What theory is App Links based on?

   App Links is based on the principle of ‘Deep-linking‘, which involve
   linking to specific screens (pages) within apps and launching mobile
   apps via links.

Which platforms do App Links support?

   App url deeplinks is cross platform

   App Links are cross-platform and currently support iOS, Android and
   Windows Phones. However, they can also be extended to support other
   platforms.

Are App Links free?

   App Links are open source, so you can use them without paying for it.
   You can also change them to suit any platform or environment.

How do they work?

   They let you link from an app to specific screens within the same or a
   different app. In short, they work like URLs for websites.

   How App Links work

Example 1 – Linking to a screen in the same app

   If I have opened a Facebook page on my Facebook app, and if I want to
   share a link of that page (without visiting the Facebook website) from
   the app with my friend, then I will use its URL (App Link) and share it
   with my friend using the messages or chat window.

Example 2 – Linking to a screen in a different app

   Pinterest mobile app linked from Facebook app using App Links

Linking Pinterest app from inside of a Facebook app

   Provided that some conditions are satisfied, you can link to a tweet in
   Twitter app from your Facebook app using App Links . The requirements
   are that both Facebook and Twitter need to have App Links enabled. Now,
   Facebook app has built-in App Links functionality, but Twitter has a
   different set of deeplinks as part of its feature called Twitter Cards.
   Since, not both the apps have App Links, it is not possible to link
   them.

   However, you can link an app like Pinterest (which supports App Links)
   with Facebook app. All you have to do is to go to a screen in
   Pinterest, copy the App Link (or URI), then open your Facebook app and
   paste it in your status update. Your friends who click on the link on a
   desktop will be shown download links for Pinterest app for platforms
   like iOS, Android or Windows Phone; however, they won’t being able to
   download the Pinterest app on their laptop. The friends who click on
   the link through a mobile device, will be directed to the image URL
   (regardless of the mobile platform) if they have the Pinterest app
   installed; if they don’t have the Pinterest app, they will be directed
   to the download link for that particular platform, clicking on which
   would take them to the image URL.

What is the minimum requirement for App Links to work?

   For App Links to work, the linking and the linked apps should have App
   Links enabled.

How to enable App Links for an app?

   App Links can be enabled for an app by defining customized Universal
   Resource Identifiers (URIs) for that app and adding specific tags in
   the codes of that app.

What are the different types of App links in the market?

   App Links is a name of a certain type of deeplinks which have been
   instituted by AppLinks.org. Some other companies have also developed
   links for apps, with a different set of features compared to App Links.
   They are as follows:

Cellogic Ltd’s Deeplink

   The Deeplink.me services help in making your app pages linkable through
   deeplinks,  just like App Links. The links build using deeplink.me
   function for app pages of an app on all platforms. They also offer
   translation rules for customized URIs, user engagement analytics, link
   fallbacks in the case of an emergency/failure and Twitter Card (see
   below) support. Apart from that, deeplink.me services support
   retargeting in apps that help you retain customers and increase sales.
   It also offers features that facilitate app discovery by search engine
   spiders.


    While Deeplink.me offers a range of features with improved
    functionality, what sets it apart is that no SDKs are required to set
    up deeplinks for an app. All that need to be done is set an app up in
    Deeplink.me portal and the app pages get deeplinked with
    URIs.Deeplink.me is a paid service, since it involves extensive use
    of their app portal. The major companies that have implemented
    deeplinks offered by Cellogic Ltd are JackThreads, ThreadFlip and
    Shazam.

    Deeplinks are paid, like most other marketing-oriented services.

Google Search Results Indexed App Deeplinks


    Google Search Results Indexed App Deeplinks
    Google indexes apps, if an app is enabled with Google App Indexing
    API. What it means is, Google can display results that include
    specific pages of an app, each with distinct URIs. So, users who
    perform searches on their smartphones get search results also from
    mobile apps, instead of just websites.

results


    Eg. If you search for ‘heaters’ on Google, then search results will
    include a list of heaters retrieved from eBay app, replete with
    ratings, reviews, information and the URI to the particular screen
    within the eBay app.
    Enabling Google Search Results App Deeplinks is a three-step process.
    First you have to implement deeplinks in your app. Second step
    involves connecting your website with your app, and the third step
    involves verifying your website with Google. This service is only
    available for Android app development right now.

Tapstream’s Deferred Links


    Links to a specific screen or a landing within an app through URIs,
    text ads or image ads. Clicking on the link or the ad takes users to
    the destination screen within the app. It does this in two ways

    1. If the user has the destination app installed, it directly takes
       him to that particular screen, displaying a brief message during
       the redirect
    2. If the user does not have the destination app installed, it takes
       the users to the download page for that app for that platform, then
       as the app is getting installed it displays a message indicating
       that the user will be directed to the landing page.

   Tapstream’s Deferred Links are mainly for app marketing companies who
   intend to make use of Landing Pages within their apps to generate
   quality leads. The Deferred Links are paid, and have different price
   points.

Twitter’s App Cards

   Twitter’s App Cards
   One of the several different Twitter Cards, through App Cards you can
   tweet a link to any webpage on your website and Twitter will
   automatically display your tweet alongside an App Card. This App Card
   would show all the data regarding your app like screenshot, ratings,
   free or paid app, description and a link to its App Store depending on
   the mobile platform you prefer. For this to work, you should have the
   App Card enabled in your website and have specified your card type and
   app IDs for iOS and Android. Twitter App Card with detailed app
   information

whose download link was tweeted

   This App Card can also show links to specific pages within the app for
   the website, provided the app has deeplinking enabled.
   URX’s Omnilinks, Omnilinks.js and App Search
   Enabling Omnilinks and deeplink Analytics for an app

Prepending the URX code at the front of URI for an app enables Omnilinks and
Analytics

   URX has developed two separate approaches for deeplinking within apps.
   Omnilinks helps users to link to specifc pages within the same or a
   different app. This approach is especially useful if a user doesn’t
   have an app installed, in which case the user is directed to the
   download link for the app on the platform-specific app store. And, if
   the user already has an app installed, he is directly taken to the
   specific screen within the app. This facility is extremely useful to
   marketers who intend to increase their app downloads by directing
   people towards it through social media and other marketing channels.
   Linking from Gmail to Bleach Report Omnilinks

Linking from Gmail to the Bleacher Report app using Omnilinks

   The Omnilinks.js approach is only for deeplinking within apps that
   users have already downloaded. So, this approach doesn’t work for the
   apps that a user hasn’t downloaded. Omnilinks.js can be used for
   in-house staff usage for easy transitions from website to mobile app
   and vice versa.
   To create both these types of Omnilinks, no changes in the code are
   required. You just need to add ‘http://urx.io/’ before your URI to
   create omnilink.
   Requirement: For Omnilinks to work, an app must have deeplinks, without
   which the URX Omnilinks are to link between apps. Similarly, websites
   must have appropriate meta tags enabled to make it possible to link
   them to an app. URX’s Omnilinks support App Links tags, so if you App
   Links tags enabled, you just have to prepend the URX code to the URI.
   App Search: This feature allows apps to scour the content present on
   other apps and also link to the respective pages of that app.

Are all these different types of App Links (i.e deep links) cross-compatible?

   Unfortunately, only some of these compatible with each other (App Links
   and URX’s Omnilinks). The reason for that is, all the services are
   provided by different companies or organisation, and since no two
   services have been widely adopted by the masses yet, third-parties who
   can combine the features of the many services have yet to come up.

Why is there a dire need for App Links?

   Currently, the pages or screens of apps don’t have appended URIs the
   way websites have URLs. So, it is impossible to locate specific pages
   within an app or share those pages with others.<

Which companies have adopted AppLinks?

   Facebook, a partner in the AppLinks initiative, has implemented them
   across most of its features. App Links currently supports News Feed,
   pages, status updates and links shared by apps. Top mobile apps like
   Mailbox, Quip, and Spotify also have deeply integrated AppLinks.
   Some major companies have recently made their content available for
   linking. They are: Pinterest, Redfin, Goodreads, Edomondo, Hulu,
   Flixter, Wattpad, Venmo, MovieTickets.com, Mixcloud, Rdio, SoundCloud,
   Tumblr, EyeEm, Houzz, Flickr, Vevo, Vimeo, Rhapsody, Fancy.com, iHeart,
   Songkick, and DailyMotion.

Why are App Links a good investment of your time and resources?

   App Links are slightly complicated, and might take some time to
   implement and a little more to perfect, but they give you so many other
   things in return.
   First of all, they help you drive your app downloads, regardless of the
   platform, if visitors happen to stumble across the app download link.
   This will, in turn, also lead to an increase in paid app or ad revenue
   from your mobile app.
   f the familiarity and convenience that App Links provide. This also
   increase the visibility of your app, which unlike your website, stays
   hidden from the eyes of people most of the times.
   Most importantly, since not many companies have implemented App Links,
   they will also lend your app or website a novel factor. So, people will
   keep coming back or download the app just to experience something new.

How do I start implementing App Links from scratch?

   If you are implementing App Links for the first time, then use Facebook
   SDK to deeplink your mobile app. Facebook has provided comprehensive
   documentation along with how-tos (with screenshots) on how to implement
   App Links as well as all the special features. Also, using Facebook SDK
   would help you leverage your website’s social media presence to
   increase downloads of your app and thus generate revenue.

What are some new or additional features of App Links?

   Analytics
   App Links have inbuilt functionality to measure and analyse how they
   are being used with apps. They can track the clicks, the landing pages,
   time, date, frequency and other data to give you a comprehensive lists
   and graphs of analytics. Using these analytics, you can optimize the
   integration of App Links into your app to enrich the experience of
   users or generate revenue from your app. To set up Analytics for App
   Links you have include lines of code on Bolts SDK, which is found in
   Facebook SDK. Since there is no SDK to support Bolts SDK except that of
   Facebook, this functionality is difficult to implement with other
   services.
   Launching Outbound Apps

   A feature similar to one designed by Tapstream for its ‘Deferred
   Links’, it allow users to click-through from an existing app to other
   apps. For example, if they click on an ad in one app, they will be
   taken to a landing page or screen on another app.

Issues, Problems, Worries and Difficulties:

     * The cross-platform compatibility of App Links also makes it a bit
       more complicated. There are three major mobile platforms (iOS,
       Android and Windows Phone) in the mobile app market. If you have
       the same app available on different platforms, you have to define
       platform-specific tags and make changes to code for each of your
       apps.
     * The transition from a website to an app or vice versa is not smooth
       and seamless because of the obvious differences between websites
       and apps. All the pages in a website cannot be linked to screen in
       an app, as app use much less real and are extremely simplistic in
       nature.
     * Linking to a screen from one app to a different app can also be
       really disruptive. For example, if I link from Facebook app to The
       Huffington Post and I used my Twitter account to log in to The
       Huffington Post, then I will be taken to the Twitter app first to
       login, after which I will redirected to The Huffington Post app. It
       is also possible that I might be directed to the download link for
       Twitter app even though it is already installed on my smartphone.
     * Most of the services listed here (excluding App Links) are not
       available to Windows Phone apps. So, there is still no way for App
       Links to deeplink to your Windows Phone app.

   PS: I have used ‘screen’ and ‘page’ interchangeably for an app. Both
   mean the same, a screen or a page within an app. Also, I have used App
   Links instead of the oft-used generic term for mobile app links i.e
   ‘deeplinks’ to make understanding this new concept simpler.
