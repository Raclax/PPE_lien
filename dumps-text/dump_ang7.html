The Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Violence Toward Humans

   People who hurt animals don’t stop with animals. There is an
   established link between cruelty to animals and violence toward
   humans — regularly referred to as “The Link.”

   This link makes it critically important that cruelty toward animals be
   taken seriously by law enforcement, and by society at large. This is
   for the sake of the animals themselves, and for people who are also at
   risk.

Research Shows the Link Between Cruelty to Animals and Toward Humans

   Ample research backs up the finding that there is a direct link between
   acts of cruelty to animals and violence toward humans. This includes
   child abuse, domestic violence, elder abuse and other violent behavior.

   Here are just a handful of examples of the research supporting that
   conclusion:

   A landmark 1997 study by the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention
   of Cruelty to Animals and Northeastern University found that animal
   abusers are in fact five times as likely to also harm other humans.

   Another study, published in 2013, found that 43% of those who commit
   school massacres also committed acts of cruelty to animals — generally
   against cats and dogs.

   Phil Arkow, coordinator of the National Link Coalition — a group
   focusing on the intersection between violence toward animals and humans
   — has written often about animal abuse being an indication of domestic
   violence, or what’s called a “predictor crime.”

   Indeed, a 1983 study notes that animal abuse was found in 88% of homes
   in which physical child abuse was being investigated.

   If a child is cruel to animals, research shows it may be a sign that
   serious abuse or neglect has been inflicted on the child. Children who
   witness animal abuse are at greater risk of becoming abusers
   themselves.

   A 2017 study showed that 89% of women who had companion animals during
   an abusive relationship reported that their animals were threatened,
   harmed, or killed by their abusive partner.

   This finding is in line with other research showing that domestic
   violence toward pets both correlates with domestic violence toward
   humans, and is also a tool of domestic abuse — violent members of the
   household will threaten to hurt or actually hurt a companion animal as
   a method of control and a form of emotional violence. Indeed, more than
   half of women in domestic violence shelters report that they delayed
   their escape out of fear for their animals.

The Law Must Protect Animals and Punish Animal Abusers

   Both because animals themselves need protection, and because of the
   link between cruelty to animals and cruelty to humans, violence against
   animals must be taken seriously under the law.

   There are some ways in which the law is reflecting this seriousness.
   For example, all 50 states now have felony animal cruelty laws on the
   books. Nearly two thirds of states allow pets to be included in
   domestic violence protective orders. These are just among the advances
   we’ve seen at the state level in this area.

   There are felony provisions in all 50 states and the District of
   Columbia for intentionally killing a dog or cat.

   At the federal level, there is progress, too. As of 2016 the FBI began
   tracking crimes against animals in the National Incident Based
   Reporting System (NIBRS), in the same way it tracks other serious
   criminal offenses. This tracking will help paint a better picture of
   who is committing crimes against animals, and where these crimes are
   taking place — and will thus also help indicate where humans are also
   at risk.

   But we are not yet at the point where cruelty to animals is
   consistently reported, investigated, prosecuted, or punished in ways
   that match the seriousness of the crime.

How to Help

   The law is only just beginning to catch up with the Americans’
   widespread view that animals are family members who need robust
   protection under the law. This is both for the sake of animal victims
   and for the safety of communities more broadly.

   Animal protection laws vary from state to state, and so we face a
   patchwork of laws across the country. To see how well your state is
   protecting animals, and where it needs improvement, see the Animal
   Legal Defense Fund’s annual State Rankings Report, ranking the animal
   protection laws of all 50 states.

   You can also let your lawmakers know that you care about this issue,
   and that you want to see your state’s animal protection laws
