                   1.5 Access Networks and Physical Media

   In sections 1.3 and 1.4 we have examined the roles of end systems and
   routers in a network architecture.  In this section we consider the
   access network - the physical link(s) that connect an end system to its
   edge router, i.e., the first router on a path from the end system to
   any other distant end system..  Since access network technology is
   closely tied to physical media technology (fiber, coaxial pair, twisted
   pair telephone wire, radio spectrum), we consider these two topics
   together in this section.

                             1.5.1 Access Networks

    Figure 1.5-1 shows the access networks' links highlighted in red.

                        Figure 1.5-1: Access networks

   Access networks can be loosely divided into three categories:
     * residential access networks, connecting a home end system into the
       network;
     * institutional access networks, connecting an end system in a
       business or educational institution into the network;
     * mobile access networks, connecting a mobile end system into the
       network

   These categories are not hard and fast; some corporate end systems may
   well use the access network technology that we ascribe to residential
   access networks, and vice versa.   Our descriptions below are meant to
   hold for the common (if not every) case.

  Residential Access Networks

   A residential access network connects a home end system (typically a
   PC, but perhaps a Web TV or other residential system) to an edge
   router. Probably the most common form of home access is using a modem
   over a POTS (plain old telephone system) dialup line to an Internet
   service provider (ISP). The home modem converts the digital output of
   the PC into analog format  for transmission over the analog phone
   line.  A modem in the ISP converts the analog signal back into digital
   form for input to the ISP router.  In this case, the "access network"
   is simply a point-to-point dialup link into an edge router.  The
   point-to-point link is your ordinary twisted-pair phone line. (We will
   discuss twisted pair later in this section.) Today's modem speeds allow
   dialup access at rates up to 56 Kbps.  However, due to the poor quality
   of twisted-pair line between many homes and ISPs, many users get an
   effective rate significantly less than 56 Kbps.  For an in depth
   discussion of the practical aspects of modems see the Institute for
   Global Communications (IGC) web page on Modems and Data Communications.

   While dialup modems require conversion of the end system's digital data
   into analog form for transmission, so-called narrowband ISDN technology
   (Integrated Services Digital Network) [Pacific Bell 1998] allows for
   all-digital transmission of data from a home end system over ISDN
   "telephone" lines to a phone company central office.  Although ISDN was
   originally conceived as a way to carry digital data from one end of the
   phone system to another, it is also an important network access
   technology that  provides higher speed access (e.g., 128 Kbps)  from
   the home into a data network such as the Internet.  In this case, ISDN
   can be thought of simply as a "better modem" [NAS 1995].  A good source
   for additional WWW information on ISDN is Dan Kegel's ISDN page.

   Dialup modems and narrowband ISDN are already widely deployed
   technologies. Two new technologies, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line
   (ADSL) [ADSL 1998] and hybrid fiber coaxial cable (HFC) [Cable 1998]
   are currently being deployed.  ADSL is conceptually similar to dialup
   modems: it is a new modem technology again running over existing
   twisted pair telephone lines, but can transmit at rates of up to about
   8 Mbps from the ISP router to a home end system.  The data rate in the
   reverse direction, from the home end system to the central office
   router, is less than 1 Mbps.  The asymmetry in the access speeds gives
   rise to the term "Asymmetric" in ADSL.  The asymmetry in the data rates
   reflects the belief that home users are more likely to be a consumer of
   information (bringing data into their homes) than a producer of
   information.

   ADSL uses frequency division multiplexing, as described in the previous
   section. In particular, ADSL divides the communication link between the
   home the ISP into three non-overlapping frequency bands:

     * a high-speed downstream channel, in the 50 KHz to 1 MHz band;
     * a medium-speed upstream channel, in the 4 KHz to 50 KHz band;
     * and an ordinary POTs two-way telephone channel, in the 0 to 4 KHz
       band.

   One of the features of ADSL is that the service allows the user to make
   an ordinary telephone call, using the POTs channel, while
   simultaneously surfing the Web. This feature is not available with
   standard dailup modems. The actually amount of downstream and upstream
   bandwidth available to the user is a function of the distance between
   the home modem and the ISP modem, the gauge of the twisted pair line,
   and the degree of electrical interference. For a high-quality line with
   negligible electrical interference, an 8 Mbps downstream transmission
   rate is possible if the distance between the home and the ISP is less
   than 3,000 meters; the downstream transmission rate drops to about 2
   Mbps for a distance of 6,000 meters. The upstream rate ranges from 16
   Kbps to 1 Mbps.

   While ADSL, ISDN and dailup modems all use ordinary phone lines, HFC
   access networks are extensions of the current cable network used for
   broadcasting cable television.  In a traditional cable system, a cable
   head end station broadcasts through a distribution of coaxial cable and
   amplifiers to residences. (We discuss coaxial cable later in this
   chapter.)  As illustrated in Figure 1.5-2,  fiber optics (also to be
   discussed soon) connect the cable head end to neighborhood-level
   junctions, from which traditional coaxial cable is then used to reach
   individual houses and apartments. Each neighborhood juncture typically
   supports 500 to 5000 homes.

                                 [cable.jpg]
              Figure 1.5-2: A hybrid fiber-coax access network

   As with ADSL, HFC requires special modems, called cable modems.
   Companies that provide cable Internet access require their customers to
   either purchase or lease a modem. One such company is CyberCable, which
   uses Motorola's CyberSurfer Cable Modem and provides high-speed
   Internet access to most of the neighborhoods in Paris. Typically, the
   cable modem is an external device and connects to the home PC through a
   10-BaseT Ethernet port. (We will discuss Ethernet in great detail in
   Chapter 5.)  Cable modems divide the HFC network into two channels, a
   downstream and an upstream channel. As with ADSL, the downstream
   channel is typically allocated more bandwidth and hence a larger
   transmission rate. For example, the downstream rate of the CyberCable
   system is 10 Mbps and the upstream rate is 768 Kbps. However, with HFC
   (and not with ADSL), these rates are shared among the homes, as we
   discuss below.

   One important characteristic of the HFC is that it is a shared
   broadcast medium. In particular, every packet sent by the headend
   travels downstream on every link to every home; and every packet sent
   by a home travels on the upstream channel to the headend. For this
   reason, if several users are receiving different Internet videos on the
   downstream channel, actual rate at which each user receives its video
   will be significantly less than downstream rate. On the other hand, if
   all the active users are Web surfing, then each of the users may
   actually receive Web pages at the full downstream rate, as a small
   collection of users will rarely receive a Web page at exactly the same
   time. Because the upstream channel is also shared, packets sent by two
   different homes at the same time will collide, which further decreases
   the effective upstream bandwidth. (We will discuss this collision issue
   in some detail when we discuss Ethernet in Chapter 5.) Advocates of
   ADSL are quick to point out that ADSL is a point-to-point connection
   between the home and ISP, and therefore all the ADSL bandwidth is
   dedicated rather than shared. Cable advocates, however, argue that a
   reasonably dimensioned HFC network provides higher bandwidths than ADSL
   [@Home 1998].  The battle between ADSL and HFC for high speed
   residential access has clearly begun, e.g., [@Home 1998].

  Enterprise Access Networks

    In enterprise access networks, a local area network (LAN) is used to
   connect an end system to an edge router.   As we will see in Chapter 5,
   there are many different types of LAN technology.  However,  Ethernet
   technology is currently by far the most prevalent access technology in
   enterprise networks. Ethernet operates 10 Mbps or 100Mbps (and now even
   at 1 Gbps). It uses either twisted-pair copper wire are coaxial cable
   to connect  a number of end systems with each other and with an edge
   router.  The edge router is responsible for routing packets that have
   destinations outside of that LAN.  Like HFC, Ethernet uses a shared
   medium, so that end users share the the transmission rate of the LAN.
   More recently, shared Ethernet technology has been migrating towards
   switched Ethernet technology.  Switched Ethernet uses multiple coaxial
   cable or twisted pair Ethernet segments connected at a "switch"  to
   allow the full bandwidth an Ethernet to be delivered to different users
   on the same LAN simultaneously [Cisco 1998]. We will explore shared and
   switched Ethernet in some detail in Chapter 5.


  Mobile Access Networks

   Mobile access networks use the radio spectrum to connect a mobile end
   system (e.g., a laptop PC or a PDA with a wireless modem) to a base
   station, as shown in Figure 1.5-1.  This base station, in turn, is
   connected to an edge router of a data network.

   An emerging standard for wireless data networking is Cellular Digital
   Packet Data (CDPD) [Wireless 1998].  As the name suggests, a CDPD
   network operates as an overlay network (i.e., as a separate, smaller
   "virtual" network, as a piece of the larger network) within the
   cellular telephone network.  A CDPD network thus uses the same radio
   spectrum as the cellular phone system, and operates at speeds in the
   10's of Kbits per second.  As with cable-based access networks and
   shared Ethernet, CDPD end systems must share the transmission media
   with other CDPD end systems within the cell covered by a base station.
   A media access control (MAC) protocol is used to arbitrate channel
   sharing among the CDPD end systems; we will cover MAC protocols in
   detail in Chapter 5.

   The CDPD system supports the IP protocol, and thus allows an IP end
   system to exchange IP packets over the wireless channel with an IP base
   station.  A CDPD network can actually support multiple network layer
   protocols; in addition to IP, the ISO CNLP protocol is also supported.
   CDPD does not provide for any protocols above the network layer.  From
   an Internet perspective, CDPD can be viewed as extending the Internet
   dialtone (i.e., the ability to transfer IP packets) across a wireless
   link between a mobile end system and an Internet router. An excellent
   introduction to CDPD is [Waung 98].

  1.5.2 Physical Media

   In the previous subsection we gave an overview of some of the most
   important access network technologies in the Internet. While describing
   these technologies, we also indicated the physical media used. For
   example, we said that HFC uses a combination of fiber cable and coaxial
   cable. We said that ordinary modems, ISDN, and ADSL use twisted-pair
   copper wire. And we said that  mobile access network use the radio
   spectrum. In this subsection we provide a brief overview of these and
   other transmission media that are commonly employed in the Internet.

   In order to define what is meant by a "physical medium,", let us
   reflect on the brief life of a bit. Consider a bit traveling from one
   end system, through a series of links and routers, to another end
   system. This poor bit gets transmitted many, many times! The source
   end-system first transmits the bit and shortly thereafter the first
   router in the series receives the bit; the first router then transmits
   the bit and shortly afterwards the second router receives the bit, etc.
   Thus our bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through
   a series of transmitter-receiver pairs. For each transmitter-receiver
   pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves across a
   physical medium. The physical medium can take many shapes and forms,
   and does not have to be of the same type for each transmitter-receiver
   pair along the path. Examples of physical media include twisted-pair
   copper wire, coaxial cable, multimode fiber optic cable, terrestrial
   radio spectrum and satellite radio spectrum. Physical media fall into
   two categories: guided media and unguided media. With guided media, the
   waves are guided along a solid medium, such as a fiber-optic cable, a
   twisted-pair cooper wire or a coaxial cable. With unguided media, the
   waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space, such as in a
   digital satellite channel or in a CDPD system.

  Some Popular Physical Media

   Suppose you want to wire a building to allow computers to access the
   Internet or an intranet -- should you use twisted-pair copper wire,
   coaxial cable, or fiber optics? Which of these media gives the highest
   bit rates over the longest distances? We shall address these questions
   below.

   But before we get into the characteristics of the various guided medium
   types, let us say a few words about their costs. The actual cost of the
   physical link (copper wire, fiber optic cable, etc.) is often
   relatively minor compared with the other networking costs. In
   particular, the labor cost associated with the installation of the
   physical link can be orders of magnitude higher than the cost of the
   material. For this reason, many builders install twisted pair, optical
   fiber, and coaxial cable to every room in a building. Even if only one
   medium is initially used, there is a good chance that another medium
   could be used in the near future, and so money is saved but not having
   to lay additional wires.

   Twisted-Pair Copper Wire

   The least-expensive and most commonly-used transmission medium is
   twisted-pair copper wire. For over one-hundred years it has been used
   by telephone networks. In fact, more than 99% of the wired connections
   from the telephone handset to the local telephone switch use
   twisted-pair copper wire. Most of us have seen twisted pair in our
   homes and work environments. Twisted pair consists of two insulated
   copper wires, each about 1 mm thick, arranged in a regular spiral
   pattern; see Figure 1.5-3.  The wires are twisted together to reduce
   the electrical interference from similar pairs close by.  Typically, a
   number of pairs are bundled together in a cable by wrapping the pairs
   in a protective shield. A wire pair constitutes a single communication
   link.

                               [grentwist.gif]
                         Figure 1.5-3: Twisted Pair

   Unshielded twisted pair (UTP) is commonly used for computer networks
   within a building, that is, for local area networks (LANs). Data rates
   for LANs using twisted pair today range from 10 Mbps to 100 Mbps. The
   data rates that can be achieved depend on the thickness of the wire and
   the distance between transmitter and receiver. Two types of UTP are
   common in LANs: category 3 and category 5. Category 3 corresponds to
   voice-grade twisted pair, commonly found in office buildings. Office
   buildings are often prewired with two or more parallel pairs of
   category 3 twisted pair; one pair is used for telephone communication,
   and the additional pairs can be used for additional telephone lines or
   for LAN networking. 10 Mbps Ethernet, one of the most prevalent LAN
   types, can use category 3 UTP. Category 5, with its more twists per
   centimeter and Teflon insulation, can handle higher bit rates. 100 Mbps
   Ethernet running on category 5 UTP has become very popular  in recent
   years. In recent years, category 5 UTP has become common for
   preinstallation in new office buildings.

   When fiber-optic technology emerged in the 1980s, many people
   disparaged twisted-pair  because of its relatively low bit rates. Some
   people even felt that fiber optic technology would completely replace
   twisted pair. But twisted pair did not give up so easily. Modern
   twisted-pair technology, such as category 5 UTP, can achieve data rates
   of 100 Mbps for distances up to a few hundred meters. Even higher rates
   are possible over shorter distances. In the end, twisted-pair has
   emerged as the dominant  solution for high-speed LAN networking.

   As discussed in Section 1.5.1, twisted-pair is also commonly used for
   residential Internet access. We saw that dial-up modem technology
   enables access at rates of up to 56 Kbps over twisted pair. We also saw
   that ISDN is available in many communities, providing access rates of
   about 128 Kbps over twisted pair. We also saw that ADSL (Asymmetric
   Digital Subscriber Loop) technology has enabled residential users to
   access the Web at rates in excess of 6 Mbps over twisted pair.

   Coaxial-Cable

   Like twisted pair, coaxial cable consists of two copper conductors, but
   the two conductors are concentric rather than parallel. With this
   construction and a special insulation and shielding, coaxial cable can
   have higher bit rates than twisted pair. Coaxial cable comes in two
   varieties: baseband coaxial cable and broadband coaxial cable.

   Baseband coaxial cable, also called 50-ohm cable, is about a centimeter
   thick, lightweight, and easy to bend. It is  commonly used in LANs; in
   fact, the computer you use at work or at school is probably connected
   to a LAN with either baseband coaxial cable or with UTP. Take a look at
   the the connection to your computer's interface card. If you see a
   telephone-like jack and some wire that resembles telephone wire, you
   are using UTP; if you see a T-connector and a cable running out of both
   sides of the T-connector, you are using baseband coaxial cable. The
   terminology "baseband" comes from the fact that the stream of bits is
   dumped directly into the cable, without shifting the signal to a
   different frequency band. 10 Mbps Ethernets can use either UTP or
   baseband coaxial cable. As we will discuss in the Chapter 5, it is a
   little more expensive to use UTP for 10 Mbps Ethernet, as UTP requires
   an additional networking device, called a hub.

   Broadband coaxial cable, also called 75-ohm cable, is quite a bit
   thicker, heavier, and stiffer than the baseband variety. It was once
   commonly used in LANs and can still be found in some older
   installations. For LANs, baseband cable is now preferable, since it is
   less expensive, easier to physically handle, and does not require
   attachment cables. Broadband cable, however, is quite common in cable
   television systems. As we saw in Section 1.5.1, cable television
   systems have been recently been coupled with cable modems to provide
   residential users with Web access at rates of 10 Mbps or higher. With
   broadband coaxial cable, the transmitter shifts the digital signal to a
   specific frequency band, and the resulting analog signal is sent from
   the transmitter to one or more receivers. Both baseband and broadband
   coaxial cable can be used as a guided shared medium. Specifically, a
   number of end systems can be connected directly to the cable, and all
   the end systems receive whatever any one of the computers transmits. We
   will look at this issue in more detail in Chapter 5.

   Fiber Optics

   An optical fiber is a thin, flexible medium that conducts pulses of
   light, with each pulse representing a bit. A single optical fiber can
   support tremendous bit rates, up to tens or even hundreds of gigabits
   per second. They are immune to electromagnetic interference, have very
   low signal attenuation up to 100 kilometers, and are very hard to tap.
   These characteristics have made fiber optics the preferred long-haul
   guided transmission media, particularly for overseas links. Many of the
   long-distance telephone networks in the United States and elsewhere now
   use fiber optics exclusively. Fiber optics is also prevalent in the
   backbone of the Internet. However, the high cost of optical devices --
   such as transmitters, receivers, and switches -- has hindered their
   deployment for short-haul transport, such as in a LAN or into the home
   in a residential access network. AT&T Labs provides an excellent site
   on fiber optics, including several nice animations.

   Terrestrial and Satellite Radio Channels

   Radio channels carry signals in the electromagnetic spectrum.  They are
   an attractive media because require no physical "wire" to be installed,
   can penetrate walls, provide connectivity to a mobile user, and can
   potentially carry a signal for long distances. The characteristics a
   radio channel depend significantly on the propagation environment and
   the distance over which a signal is to be carried. Environmental
   considerations determine path loss and shadow fading (which decrease in
   signal strength as it travels over a distance and around/through
   obstructing objects), multipath fading (due to signal reflection off of
   interfering objects),  and interference (due to other radio channels or
   electromagnetic signals).

   Terrestrial radio channels can be broadly classified into two groups:
   those that operate as local area networks (typically spanning 10's to a
   few hundred meters) and wide-area radio channels that are used for
   mobile data services (typically operating within a metropolitan
   region).  A number of wireless LAN products are on the market,
   operating in the 1 to 10's of Mbps range. Mobile data services (such as
   the CDPD standard we touched on in section 1.3), typically provide
   channels that operate at 10's of Kbps.  See  [Goodman 97] for a survey
   and discussion of the technology and products.

   A communication satellite links two or more earth-based microwave
   transmitter/receivers, known as ground stations. The satellite receives
   transmissions on one frequency band, regenerates the signal using a
   repeater (discussed below), and transmits the signal on another
   frequency. Satellites can provide bandwidths in the gigabit per second
   range. Two types of satellites are used in communications:
   geostationary satellites and low-altitude satellites.

   Geostationary satellites permanently remain above the same spot on the
   Earth. This stationary presence is achieved by placing the satellite in
   orbit at 36,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface. This huge
   distance between from ground station though satellite back to ground
   station introduces a substantial signal propagation delay of 250
   milliseconds. Nevertheless, satellites links are often used in
   telephone networks and in the backbone of the Internet.

   Low-altitude satellites are placed much closer to the Earth and do not
   remain permanently above one spot on the Earth. They rotate around the
   Earth just as the Moon rotates around the Earth. To provide continuous
   coverage to an area, many satellites to be placed in orbit. There are
   currently many low-altitude communication systems in development. The
   Iridium system, for example, consists of 66 low-altitude satellites.
   Lloyd's satellite constellations provides and collects information on
   Iridium as well as other satellite constellation systems. The
   low-altitude satellite technology may be used for Internet access
   sometime in the future.
