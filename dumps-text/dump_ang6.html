Abstract

   Theorists have long assumed that people's self-esteem and social
   relationships influence each other. However, the empirical evidence has
   been inconsistent, creating substantial uncertainty about whether
   relationships are in fact an influential factor in self-esteem
   development and vice versa. This meta-analysis synthesizes the
   available longitudinal data on the prospective effect of social
   relationships on self-esteem (48 samples including 46,231 participants)
   and the prospective effect of self-esteem on social relationships (35
   samples including 21,995 participants). All effects controlled for
   prior levels of the outcomes. Results showed that relationships and
   self-esteem reciprocally predict each other over time with similar
   effect sizes (β = .08 in both directions). Moderator analyses suggested
   that the effects held across sample characteristics such as mean age,
   gender, ethnicity, and time lag between assessments, except for the
   self-esteem effect on relationships, which was moderated by type of
   relationship partner (stronger for general relationships than for
   specific partners) and relationship reporter (stronger for
   self-reported than for informant-reported relationship
   characteristics). The findings support assumptions of classic and
   contemporary theories on the influence of social relationships on
   self-esteem and on the consequences of self-esteem for the relationship
   domain. In sum, the findings suggest that the link between people's
   social relationships and their level of self-esteem is truly reciprocal
   in all developmental stages across the life span, reflecting a positive
   feedback loop between the constructs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c)
