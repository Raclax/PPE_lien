To 'link' or 'relate' two items?

   I'm developing a system in which users can 'link' separate items by
   using a 'Link' button. In the database, this 'link' is called a
   'relation'. I'm inclined to change the text of the button to 'Relate'
   instead of 'Link' because it seems more correct. However, I fear users
   might be confused due to popular usage of the term 'relation'.

   For example, you often see a list with 'Related terms' popping up on
   websites. When you look closely, most of the time this is a list of
   terms that might have something to do with the current term you have
   selected, but don't have an actual relation to it. I would rather call
   it 'Similar terms'.

   Might 'link' therefore be a better choice after all? Or is 'relation'
   much more correct?

     * Irrespective of what the database calls it, and notwithstanding
       that it may or may not be a "relation" in a certain sense, the end
       user's perspective is that the function of the button is to
       'establish a link' and therefore Link would be the right label for
       the button.

     * Do you mean like putting together the separate items into one
       relation (table) in your database?

     * @Safira: No, they're still two separate items but you establish a
       'relationship' mainly for data integrity. So for example, when you
       delete item 1, item 2 will also be deleted. Or when you look up
       item 1, item 2 is shown as well.

     * I think, link and relate are different even in daily English. So a
       native-English user would understand even if you use link. I prefer
       link cause relate is used to put items together into a relation (a
       table), right?

   Keep link. You need a verb that can be uttered as a command.

   Verbs that are commands are best when they don't require and object.

   The meaning of link as "connect or join up" does not require an object.

   The meaning of relate as "show a connection between" can take an
   object. It doesn't always have to, but as a stand alone word relate
   makes me think of its other meaning:

     feel sympathy for or identify with

   So I would feel I was commanding the server to feel sympathy for
   whatever I've typed in.

   If you are set on using relate then I would suggest relate to be what
   you use on the button. This removes the ambiguity with the above
   definition.

     * It would be helpful if there was some explanation for the
       downvote... As for your answer, I doubt if people would feel
       they're commanding the server to feel sympathy, but I agree
       'relate' comes across as more ambiguous.
