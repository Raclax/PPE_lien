   Hyperlinks are really important — they are what makes the Web a web.
   This article shows the syntax required to make a link, and discusses
   link best practices.
   Prerequisites: Basic HTML familiarity, as covered in Getting started
   with HTML. HTML text formatting, as covered in HTML text fundamentals.
   Objective: To learn how to implement a hyperlink effectively, and link
   multiple files together.

What is a hyperlink?

   Hyperlinks are one of the most exciting innovations the Web has to
   offer. They've been a feature of the Web since the beginning, and are
   what makes the Web a web. Hyperlinks allow us to link documents to
   other documents or resources, link to specific parts of documents, or
   make apps available at a web address. Almost any web content can be
   converted to a link so that when clicked or otherwise activated the web
   browser goes to another web address (URL).

   Note: A URL can point to HTML files, text files, images, text
   documents, video and audio files, or anything else that lives on the
   Web. If the web browser doesn't know how to display or handle the file,
   it will ask you if you want to open the file (in which case the duty of
   opening or handling the file is passed to a suitable native app on the
   device) or download the file (in which case you can try to deal with it
   later on).

   For example, the BBC homepage contains many links that point not only
   to multiple news stories, but also different areas of the site
   (navigation functionality), login/registration pages (user tools), and
   more.

   front page of bbc.co.uk, showing many news items, and navigation menu
   functionality

Anatomy of a link

   A basic link is created by wrapping the text or other content inside an
   <a> element and using the href attribute, also known as a Hypertext
   Reference, or target, that contains the web address.
   html
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>

   This gives us the following result:
   I'm creating a link to the Mozilla homepage.

Block level links

   As mentioned before, almost any content can be made into a link, even
   block-level elements. If you want to make a heading element a link then
   wrap it in an anchor (<a>) element as shown in the following code
   snippet:
   html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <h1>MDN Web Docs</h1>
</a>
<p>
  Documenting web technologies, including CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, since 2005.
</p>

   This turns the heading into a link:

   IFRAME:
   https://live.mdnplay.dev/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Cre
   ating_hyperlinks/runner.html?id=block_level_links

Image links

   If you have an image you want to make into a link, use the <a> element
   to wrap the image file referenced with the <img> element. The example
   below uses a relative path to reference a locally stored SVG image
   file.
img {
  height: 100px;
  width: 150px;
  border: 1px solid gray;
}

   html
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">
  <img src="mdn_logo.svg" alt="MDN Web Docs" />
</a>

   This makes the MDN logo a link:

   IFRAME:
   https://live.mdnplay.dev/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Cre
   ating_hyperlinks/runner.html?id=image_links

   Note: You'll find out more about using images on the Web in a future
   article.

Adding supporting information with the title attribute

   Another attribute you may want to add to your links is title. The title
   contains additional information about the link, such as which kind of
   information the page contains, or things to be aware of on the website.
   html
<p>
  I'm creating a link to
  <a
    href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
    title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">
    the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>

   This gives us the following result and hovering over the link displays
   the title as a tooltip:

   IFRAME:
   https://live.mdnplay.dev/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Cre
   ating_hyperlinks/runner.html?id=adding_supporting_information_with_the_
   title_attribute

   Note: A link title is only revealed on mouse hover, which means that
   people relying on keyboard controls or touchscreens to navigate web
   pages will have difficulty accessing title information. If a title's
   information is truly important to the usability of the page, then you
   should present it in a manner that will be accessible to all users, for
   example by putting it in the regular text.

Active learning: creating your own example link

   Create an HTML document using your local code editor and our getting
   started template.
     * Inside the HTML body, add one or more paragraphs or other types of
       content you already know about.
     * Change some of the content into links.
     * Include title attributes.

A quick primer on URLs and paths

   To fully understand link targets, you need to understand URLs and file
   paths. This section gives you the information you need to achieve this.

   A URL, or Uniform Resource Locator is a string of text that defines
   where something is located on the Web. For example, Mozilla's English
   homepage is located at https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/.

   URLs use paths to find files. Paths specify where the file you're
   interested in is located in the filesystem. Let's look at an example of
   a directory structure, see the creating-hyperlinks directory.

   A simple directory structure. The parent directory is called
   creating-hyperlinks and contains two files called index.html and
   contacts.html, and two directories called projects and pdfs, which
   contain an index.html and a project-brief.pdf file, respectively

   The root of this directory structure is called creating-hyperlinks.
   When working locally with a website, you'll have one directory that
   contains the entire site. Inside the root, we have an index.html file
   and a contacts.html. In a real website, index.html would be our home
   page or landing page (a web page that serves as the entry point for a
   website or a particular section of a website.).

   There are also two directories inside our root — pdfs and projects.
   These each have a single file inside them — a PDF (project-brief.pdf)
   and an index.html file, respectively. Note that you can have two
   index.html files in one project, as long as they're in different
   filesystem locations. The second index.html would perhaps be the main
   landing page for project-related information.
     * Same directory: If you wanted to include a hyperlink inside
       index.html (the top level index.html) pointing to contacts.html,
       you would specify the filename that you want to link to, because
       it's in the same directory as the current file. The URL you would
       use is contacts.html:
       html
<p>
  Want to contact a specific staff member? Find details on our
  <a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a>.
</p>

     * Moving down into subdirectories: If you wanted to include a
       hyperlink inside index.html (the top level index.html) pointing to
       projects/index.html, you would need to go down into the projects
       directory before indicating the file you want to link to. This is
       done by specifying the directory's name, then a forward slash, then
       the name of the file. The URL you would use is projects/index.html:
       html
<p>Visit my <a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>.</p>

     * Moving back up into parent directories: If you wanted to include a
       hyperlink inside projects/index.html pointing to
       pdfs/project-brief.pdf, you'd have to go up a directory level, then
       back down into the pdfs directory. To go up a directory, use two
       dots — .. — so the URL you would use is ../pdfs/project-brief.pdf:
       html
<p>A link to my <a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>.</p>

   Note: You can combine multiple instances of these features into complex
   URLs, if needed, for example: ../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html.

Document fragments

   It's possible to link to a specific part of an HTML document, known as
   a document fragment, rather than just to the top of the document. To do
   this you first have to assign an id attribute to the element you want
   to link to. It normally makes sense to link to a specific heading, so
   this would look something like the following:
   html
<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>

   Then to link to that specific id, you'd include it at the end of the
   URL, preceded by a hash/pound symbol (#), for example:
   html
<p>
  Want to write us a letter? Use our
  <a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>.
</p>

   You can even use the document fragment reference on its own to link to
   another part of the current document:
   html
<p>
  The <a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a> can be found at the
  bottom of this page.
</p>

Absolute versus relative URLs

   Two terms you'll come across on the Web are absolute URL and relative
   URL:

   absolute URL: Points to a location defined by its absolute location on
   the web, including protocol and domain name. For example, if an
   index.html page is uploaded to a directory called projects that sits
   inside the root of a web server, and the website's domain is
   https://www.example.com, the page would be available at
   https://www.example.com/projects/index.html (or even just
   https://www.example.com/projects/, as most web servers just look for a
   landing page such as index.html to load if it isn't specified in the
   URL.)

   An absolute URL will always point to the same location, no matter where
   it's used.

   relative URL: Points to a location that is relative to the file you are
   linking from, more like what we looked at in the previous section. For
   example, if we wanted to link from our example file at
   https://www.example.com/projects/index.html to a PDF file in the same
   directory, the URL would just be the filename — project-brief.pdf — no
   extra information needed. If the PDF was available in a subdirectory
   inside projects called pdfs, the relative link would be
   pdfs/project-brief.pdf (the equivalent absolute URL would be
   https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf.)

   A relative URL will point to different places depending on the actual
   location of the file you refer from — for example if we moved our
   index.html file out of the projects directory and into the root of the
   website (the top level, not in any directories), the
   pdfs/project-brief.pdf relative URL link inside it would now point to a
   file located at https://www.example.com/pdfs/project-brief.pdf, not a
   file located at
   https://www.example.com/projects/pdfs/project-brief.pdf.

   Of course, the location of the project-brief.pdf file and pdfs folder
   won't suddenly change because you moved the index.html file — this
   would make your link point to the wrong place, so it wouldn't work if
   clicked on. You need to be careful!

Link best practices

   There are some best practices to follow when writing links. Let's look
   at these now.

Use clear link wording

   It's easy to throw links up on your page. That's not enough. We need to
   make our links accessible to all readers, regardless of their current
   context and which tools they prefer. For example:
     * Screen reader users like jumping around from link to link on the
       page, and reading links out of context.
     * Search engines use link text to index target files, so it is a good
       idea to include keywords in your link text to effectively describe
       what is being linked to.
     * Visual readers skim over the page rather than reading every word,
       and their eyes will be drawn to page features that stand out, like
       links. They will find descriptive link text useful.

   Let's look at a specific example:

   Good link text: Download Firefox
   html
<p><a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Download Firefox</a></p>

   Bad link text: Click here to download Firefox
   html
<p>
  <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/">Click here</a> to download Firefox
</p>

   Other tips:
     * Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text — URLs look ugly, and
       sound even uglier when a screen reader reads them out letter by
       letter.
     * Don't say "link" or "links to" in the link text — it's just noise.
       Screen readers tell people there's a link. Visual users will also
       know there's a link, because links are generally styled in a
       different color and underlined (this convention generally shouldn't
       be broken, as users are used to it).
     * Keep your link text as short as possible — this is helpful because
       screen readers need to interpret the entire link text.
     * Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are
       linked to different places. This can cause problems for screen
       reader users, if there's a list of links out of context that are
       labeled "click here", "click here", "click here".

Linking to non-HTML resources — leave clear signposts

   When linking to a resource that will be downloaded (like a PDF or Word
   document), streamed (like video or audio), or has another potentially
   unexpected effect (opens a popup window), you should add clear wording
   to reduce any confusion.

   For example:
     * If you're on a low bandwidth connection, click a link, and then a
       multiple megabyte download starts unexpectedly.

   Let's look at some examples, to see what kind of text can be used here:
   html
<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/large-report.pdf">
    Download the sales report (PDF, 10MB)
  </a>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="https://www.example.com/video-stream/" target="_blank">
    Watch the video (stream opens in separate tab, HD quality)
  </a>
</p>

Use the download attribute when linking to a download

   When you are linking to a resource that's to be downloaded rather than
   opened in the browser, you can use the download attribute to provide a
   default save filename. Here's an example with a download link to the
   latest Windows version of Firefox:
   html
<a
  href="https://download.mozilla.org/?product=firefox-latest-ssl&os=win64&lang=e
n-US"
  download="firefox-latest-64bit-installer.exe">
  Download Latest Firefox for Windows (64-bit) (English, US)
</a>

Active learning: creating a navigation menu

   For this exercise, we'd like you to link some pages together with a
   navigation menu to create a multipage website. This is one common way
   in which a website is created — the same page structure is used on
   every page, including the same navigation menu, so when links are
   clicked it gives the impression that you are staying in the same place,
   and different content is being brought up.

   You'll need to make local copies of the following four pages, all in
   the same directory. For a complete file list, see the
   navigation-menu-start directory:
     * index.html
     * projects.html
     * pictures.html
     * social.html

   You should:
    1. Add an unordered list in the indicated place on one page that
       includes the names of the pages to link to. A navigation menu is
       usually just a list of links, so this is semantically OK.
    2. Change each page name into a link to that page.
    3. Copy the navigation menu across to each page.
    4. On each page, remove just the link to that same page — it's
       confusing and unnecessary for a page to include a link to itself.
       And, the lack of a link acts a good visual reminder of which page
       you are currently on.

   The finished example should look similar to the following page:

   An example of a simple HTML navigation menu, with home, pictures,
   projects, and social menu items

   Note: If you get stuck, or aren't sure if you have got it right, you
   can check the navigation-menu-marked-up directory to see the correct
   answer.

Email links

   It's possible to create links or buttons that, when clicked, open a new
   outgoing email message rather than linking to a resource or page. This
   is done using the <a> element and the mailto: URL scheme.

   In its most basic and commonly used form, a mailto: link indicates the
   email address of the intended recipient. For example:
   html
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>

   This results in a link that looks like this: Send email to nowhere.

   In fact, the email address is optional. If you omit it and your href is
   "mailto:", a new outgoing email window will be opened by the user's
   email client with no destination address. This is often useful as
   "Share" links that users can click to send an email to an address of
   their choosing.

Specifying details

   In addition to the email address, you can provide other information. In
   fact, any standard mail header fields can be added to the mailto URL
   you provide. The most commonly used of these are "subject", "cc", and
   "body" (which is not a true header field, but allows you to specify a
   short content message for the new email). Each field and its value is
   specified as a query term.

   Here's an example that includes a cc, bcc, subject and body:
   html
<a
  href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtable
s.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20emai
l">
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
</a>

   Note: The values of each field must be URL-encoded with non-printing
   characters (invisible characters like tabs, carriage returns, and page
   breaks) and spaces percent-escaped. Also, note the use of the question
   mark (?) to separate the main URL from the field values, and ampersands
   (&) to separate each field in the mailto: URL. This is standard URL
   query notation. Read The GET method to understand what URL query
   notation is more commonly used for.

   Here are a few other sample mailto URLs:
     * mailto:
     * mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org
     * mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org,nobody@mozilla.org
     * mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org
     * mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org&subject=This%20is%
       20the%20subject
