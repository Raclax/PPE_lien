Physical exercise and dementia

   Of all the lifestyle changes that have been studied, taking regular
   physical exercise appears to be one of the best things that you can do
   to reduce your risk of getting dementia.

   Of all the lifestyle changes that have been studied, taking regular
   physical exercise appears to be one of the best things that you can do
   to reduce your risk of getting dementia.

   Several studies looking at the effect of aerobic exercise (exercise
   that increases your heart rate) in middle-aged or older adults have
   reported improvements in thinking and memory, and reduced rates of
   dementia.

Exercising in mid-life

   Prospective studies follow the health and behaviour of a group of
   people over time. Several prospective studies have looked at
   middle-aged people and the effects of physical exercise on their
   thinking and memory in later life. Combining the results of 11 studies
   shows that regular exercise can significantly reduce the risk of
   developing dementia by about 30 per cent. For Alzheimer's disease
   specifically, the risk was reduced by 45 per cent.

   One particular study looked at health behaviours of over 2,000 men in
   Wales, and followed them for 35 years. Of the five behaviours that were
   assessed (regular exercise, not smoking, moderate alcohol intake,
   healthy body weight and healthy diet), exercise had the greatest effect
   in terms of reducing dementia risk. Overall, people who followed four
   or five of the above behaviours were up to 60 per cent less likely to
   develop dementia.

   In the short term, aerobic exercise can also improve the performance of
   healthy adults on thinking tests. Pulling together the results of 29
   clinical trials, a month or more of regular aerobic exercise resulted
   in improvements in memory, attention and processing speed when compared
   with regular non-aerobic exercise such as stretching and toning.

Exercising in later life

   Although less research has been done with healthy older people, there
   is some evidence to show older people can also reduce their risk of
   dementia with regular exercise. In a study of 716 people with an
   average age of 82 years, people who were in the bottom 10 per cent in
   terms of amount of daily physical activity were more than twice as
   likely to develop Alzheimer's disease as those in the top 10 per cent.

   A literature review found 27 studies looking at the effect of physical
   activity on brain function in people over 60 years of age. In 26 of the
   studies there was a clear link between physical activity levels and
   cognitive performance, suggesting that exercise might be an effective
   way to reduce cognitive decline in later life.

   Aerobic exercise has also been shown to affect the brains of healthy
   older people. In a modest-sized controlled trial, one year of aerobic
   exercise resulted in a small increase in the size of the hippocampus
   (the key brain area involved in memory), which was the equivalent of
   reversing one to two years of age-related shrinkage. A study of 638
   people in Scotland that asked people about their activity levels found
   those who were physically active at age 70 experienced less brain
   shrinkage over three years than those who were not.

What does 'physical activity' mean?

   The research studies in this area do not all use the same definition of
   'physical activity' or exercise. In general they are referring to
   aerobic exercise performed for a sustained period of time, perhaps
   20–30 minutes. Most of the studies report on the effects of aerobic
   exercise done several times a week and maintained for at least a year.

   However, physical exercise does not just mean playing a sport or
   running. It can also mean a daily activity such as brisk walking,
   cleaning or gardening. One study found that the risk of Alzheimer's
   disease can be reduced by daily physical tasks such as cooking and
   washing up.

Areas of uncertainty

   Usually, we would like there to be randomised controlled trials (RCTs)
   that show how one factor can influence another. To date, no RCT has
   shown an exercise regime can prevent dementia, although there are
   several in progress across Europe.

   We need more research to understand the level and intensity of exercise
   that is most effective; this is also likely to vary throughout
   someone's life. We also need more research to understand the role that
   physical activity plays in reducing the risk of different types of
   dementia.

   Physical activity and exercise for people with dementia

   Leading a physically active lifestyle can have a significant impact on
   the wellbeing of people with dementia.
