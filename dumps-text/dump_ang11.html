Apollo Link overview

Customize Apollo Client's data flow
     __________________________________________________________________

   If your application only needs to send conventional HTTP-based requests
   to a GraphQL server, you probably don't need to use the Apollo Link
   API. See
   Basic HTTP networking.

   The Apollo Link library helps you customize the flow of data between
   Apollo Client and your GraphQL server. You can define your client's
   network behavior as a chain of link objects that execute in a sequence:

   Apollo Client
   Initiated
   down
   down
   up
   up
   Completed
   Request
   Response
   GraphQL operation
   Link
   Link
   Terminating Link
   GraphQL server

   Each link should represent either a self-contained modification to a
   GraphQL operation or a side effect (such as logging).

   In the above diagram:
    1. The first link might log the details of the operation for debugging
       purposes.
    2. The second link might add an HTTP header to the outgoing operation
       request for authentication purposes.
    3. The final (terminating) link sends the operation to its destination
       (usually a GraphQL server over HTTP).
    4. The server's response is passed back up each link in reverse order,
       enabling links to modify the response or take other actions before
       the data is cached.

   By default, Apollo Client uses Apollo Link's
   HttpLink to send GraphQL operations to a remote server over HTTP.
   Apollo Client takes care of creating this default link, and it covers
   many use cases without requiring additional customization.

   To extend or replace this default networking behavior, you can define
   custom links and specify their order of execution in the ApolloClient
   constructor.

Your first link chain

   The example below demonstrates a basic link chain with two
   Apollo-provided links:
     * An onError link that checks for errors in the server's response. It
       logs the details of whichever error(s) it finds.
     * An HttpLink that sends each GraphQL operation to your server.
          + This is the chain's terminating link.

   Note that if you provide a link chain to the ApolloClient constructor,
   you don't provide the uri option. Instead, you provide your server's
   URL to your HttpLink.

   1
   import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, HttpLink, from } from

   2
   import { onError } from "@apollo/client/link/error";
   3
   4
   const httpLink = new HttpLink({
   5
   uri: "http://localhost:4000/graphql"
   6
   });
   7
   8
   const errorLink = onError(({ graphQLErrors, networkError }) => {
   9
   if (graphQLErrors)
   10
   graphQLErrors.forEach(({ message, locations, path }) =>
   11
   console.log(
   12
   `[GraphQL error]: Message: ${message}, Location: ${locations}, Path:
   ${path}`,
   13
   ),
   14
   );
   15
   16
   if (networkError) console.log(`[Network error]: ${networkError}`);
   17
   });
   18
   19
   // If you provide a link chain to ApolloClient, you
   20
   // don't provide the `uri` option.
   21
   const client = new ApolloClient({
   22
   // The `from` function combines an array of individual links
   23
   // into a link chain
   24
   link: from([errorLink, httpLink]),
   25
   cache: new InMemoryCache()
   26
   });

Creating a custom link

   A link object is an instance of the ApolloLink class (or a subclass of
   it). Each link must define a method named request, which is known as
   the link's request handler. You can provide this method's definition to
   the ApolloLink constructor.

Example

   The following custom link defines a request handler that adds a GraphQL
   operation's approximate start time to the operation's context:
   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const timeStartLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   4
   operation.setContext({ start: new Date() });
   5
   return forward(operation);
   6
   });
   (BUTTON) Copy

   This request handler then calls return forward(operation), which is the
   syntax for calling the next link down the chain.

The request handler

   Every link must define a request method, also known as its request
   handler. This method is passed the following arguments:
     * operation: The GraphQL operation that's being passed through the
       link.
          + For details, see The Operation object.
     * forward: A function for executing the next link in the chain
       (unless this is a terminating link).

   Whenever Apollo Client prepares to execute a GraphQL operation, it
   calls the request handler of the first link in the chain. Each link is
   responsible for executing its logic and then passing execution to the
   next link by calling the forward function and returning its result.

The Operation object

   The Operation object includes the following fields:
   Name
   Description

   query A DocumentNode (parsed GraphQL operation) that describes the
   operation taking place.
   variables A map of GraphQL variables being sent with the operation.
   operationName A string name of the query if it is named, otherwise
   null.
   extensions A map to store extensions data to be sent to the server.
   getContext A function to return the context of the request. This
   context can be used by links to determine which actions to perform. See
   Managing context.
   setContext A function that takes either a new context object, or a
   function which takes in the previous context and returns a new one. See
   Managing context.

    The forward function

   When your custom link's request handler is done executing its logic, it
   should return a call to the forward function that's passed to it
   (unless it's the chain's terminating link). Calling return
   forward(operation) passes execution along to the next link in the
   chain.

   If a non-terminating custom link's request handler doesn't return
   forward(operation), the link chain ends and the associated GraphQL
   operation is not executed.

   The forward function's return type is an Observable provided by the
   zen-observable library. See the zen-observable documentation for
   details.

  Handling a response

   When your GraphQL server responds with an operation result, that result
   is passed back up through each link in your link chain before it's
   cached:

   Apollo Client
   Initiated
   down
   down
   up
   up
   Completed
   Request
   Response
   GraphQL operation
   Link
   Link
   Terminating Link
   GraphQL server

   Each link can execute logic while the result is being passed back by
   modifying their request handler's return statement, like so:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   // BEFORE (NO INTERACTION)
   2
   return forward(operation);
   3
   4
   // AFTER
   5
   return forward(operation).map((data) => {
   6
   // ...modify result as desired here...
   7
   return data;
   8
   });
   (BUTTON) Copy

   Whatever the function provided to map returns is passed to the next
   link up the chain.

   You can also perform logic here that has nothing to do with the result.
   This request handler uses the request context to estimate the
   round-trip time for each operation:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const roundTripLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   4
   // Called before operation is sent to server
   5
   operation.setContext({ start: new Date() });
   6
   7
   return forward(operation).map((data) => {
   8
   // Called after server responds
   9
   const time = new Date() - operation.getContext().start;
   10
   console.log(`Operation ${operation.operationName} took ${time} to
   complete`);
   11
   return data;
   12
   });
   13
   });
   (BUTTON) Copy

Composing a link chain

   Each link represents either a self-contained modification to a GraphQL
   operation or a side effect (such as logging). By composing these links
   into a chain, you can create an arbitrarily complex model for your
   client's data flow.

   There are two forms of link composition: additive and directional.
     * Additive composition involves combining a set of links into a
       serially executed chain:
       Link
       Link
       Terminating Link
     * Directional composition involves branching to one of two links,
       depending on the details of an operation:
       Link
       Link
       Terminating Link
       Terminating Link

   Note that no matter how your chain branches, each branch always ends in
   a terminating link.

  The terminating link

   The terminating link is the last link in a link chain. Instead of
   calling the forward function, the terminating link is responsible for
   sending your composed GraphQL operation to the destination that
   executes it (usually a GraphQL server) and returning an
   ExecutionResult.

   HttpLink and BatchHttpLink are both examples of terminating links.

  Additive composition

   If you have a collection of two or more links that should always be
   executed in serial order, use the ApolloLink.from helper method to
   combine those links into a single link, like so:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { from, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   import { RetryLink } from '@apollo/client/link/retry';
   3
   import MyAuthLink from '../auth';
   4
   5
   const additiveLink = from([
   6
   new RetryLink(),
   7
   new MyAuthLink(),
   8
   new HttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' })
   9
   ]);
   (BUTTON) Copy

  Directional composition

   You might want your link chain's execution to branch, depending on the
   details of the operation being performed.

   To support this, the @apollo/client library provides a split function
   that lets you use one of two different Links, according to the result
   of a boolean check. You can also use the split method of an ApolloLink
   instance.

   Name Description
   test A function that takes in the current Operation and returns either
   true or false depending on its details.
   left The link to execute next if the test function returns true.
   right An optional link to execute next if the test function returns
   false. If this is not provided, the request handler's forward parameter
   is used.

   In the following example, a RetryLink passes execution along to one of
   two different HttpLinks depending on the associated context's version:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   import { RetryLink } from '@apollo/client/link/retry';
   3
   4
   const directionalLink = new RetryLink().split(
   5
   (operation) => operation.getContext().version === 1,
   6
   new HttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:4000/v1/graphql' }),
   7
   new HttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:4000/v2/graphql' })
   8
   );
   (BUTTON) Copy

   Other uses for the split method include:
     * Customizing the number of allowed retry attempts depending on the
       operation type
     * Using different transport methods depending on the operation type
       (such as HTTP for queries and WebSocket for subscriptions)
     * Customizing logic depending on whether a user is logged in

   In the following example, all subscription operations are sent to
   GraphQLWsLink, with all other operations sent to HttpLink:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { split, HttpLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   import { getMainDefinition } from '@apollo/client/utilities';
   3
   import { GraphQLWsLink } from '@apollo/client/link/subscriptions';
   4
   import { createClient } from 'graphql-ws';
   5
   6
   export const link = split(
   7
   ({ query }) => {
   8
   const definition = getMainDefinition(query);
   9
   return (
   10
   definition.kind === 'OperationDefinition' &&
   11
   definition.operation === 'subscription'
   12
   );
   13
   },
   14
   new GraphQLWsLink(createClient({ url:
   'ws://localhost:3000/subscriptions' })),
   15
   new HttpLink({ uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql' })
   16
   );
   (BUTTON) Copy

  Providing to Apollo Client

   After you finish composing your entire link chain, you provide the
   resulting link to the constructor of ApolloClient, like so:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloClient, HttpLink, InMemoryCache } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   import { RetryLink } from '@apollo/client/link/retry';
   3
   4
   const directionalLink = new RetryLink().split(
   5
   (operation) => operation.getContext().version === 1,
   6
   new HttpLink({ uri: "http://localhost:4000/v1/graphql" }),
   7
   new HttpLink({ uri: "http://localhost:4000/v2/graphql" })
   8
   );
   9
   10
   const client = new ApolloClient({
   11
   cache: new InMemoryCache(),
   12
   link: directionalLink
   13
   });
   (BUTTON) Copy

Link types

  Stateless links

   Most links perform the same logic for every operation they process, and
   they don't need to know anything about operations that have been
   executed previously. These links are stateless.

   You can define the request handler for a stateless link in the
   constructor of an ApolloLink object, like so:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const consoleLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   4
   console.log(`starting request for ${operation.operationName}`);
   5
   return forward(operation).map((data) => {
   6
   console.log(`ending request for ${operation.operationName}`);
   7
   return data;
   8
   })
   9
   })
   (BUTTON) Copy

   Stateless links are great for implementing middleware and even network
   requests. The following link adds an Authorization header to every
   outgoing request:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const authLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   4
   operation.setContext(({ headers }) => ({ headers: {
   5
   authorization: Auth.userId(), // however you get your token
   6
   ...headers
   7
   }}));
   8
   return forward(operation);
   9
   });
   (BUTTON) Copy

   This style of link also composes well for customization using a
   function:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const reportErrors = (errorCallback) => new ApolloLink((operation,
   forward) => {
   4
   return new Observable((observer) => {
   5
   const observable = forward(operation);
   6
   const subscription = observable.subscribe({
   7
   next(value) {
   8
   observer.next(value);
   9
   },
   10
   error(networkError) {
   11
   errorCallback({ networkError, operation });
   12
   observer.error(networkError);
   13
   },
   14
   complete() {
   15
   observer.complete();
   16
   },
   17
   });
   18
   19
   return () => subscription.unsubscribe();
   20
   });
   21
   });
   22
   23
   const link = reportErrors(console.error);
   (BUTTON) Copy

    Extending ApolloLink

   You can also create a stateless link by extending the ApolloLink class
   and overwriting its constructor and request handler. For example,
   here's the same reportErrors link written as an extension of
   ApolloLink:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   class ReportErrorLink extends ApolloLink {
   4
   constructor(errorCallback) {
   5
   super();
   6
   this.errorCallback = errorCallback;
   7
   }
   8
   request(operation, forward) {
   9
   const observable = forward(operation);
   10
   // errors will be sent to the errorCallback
   11
   observable.subscribe({ error: this.errorCallback })
   12
   return observable;
   13
   }
   14
   }
   15
   16
   const link = new ReportErrorLink(console.error);
   (BUTTON) Copy

  Stateful links

   When it's useful, links can maintain state between operations. These
   links are stateful.

   Stateful links are usually defined as subclasses of ApolloLink. They
   override the constructor of ApolloLink and implement a request function
   with the same signature as a stateless link. For example:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   class OperationCountLink extends ApolloLink {
   4
   constructor() {
   5
   super();
   6
   this.operationCount = 0;
   7
   }
   8
   request(operation, forward) {
   9
   this.operationCount += 1;
   10
   return forward(operation);
   11
   }
   12
   }
   13
   14
   const link = new OperationCountLink();
   (BUTTON) Copy

   This stateful link maintains a counter called operationCount as an
   instance variable. Every time a request is passed through the link,
   operationCount is incremented.

Managing context

   As an operation moves along your link chain, it maintains a context
   that each link can read and modify. This allows links to pass metadata
   along the chain that other links use in their execution logic.
     * Obtain the current context object by calling
       operation.getContext().
     * Modify the context object and then write it back with
       operation.setContext(newContext) or
       operation.setContext((prevContext) => newContext).

   Note that this context is not included in the terminating link's
   request to the GraphQL server or other destination.

   Here's an example:

   (BUTTON) JavaScript

   1
   import { ApolloLink, from } from '@apollo/client';
   2
   3
   const timeStartLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   4
   operation.setContext({ start: new Date() });
   5
   return forward(operation);
   6
   });
   7
   8
   const logTimeLink = new ApolloLink((operation, forward) => {
   9
   return forward(operation).map((data) => {
   10
   // data from a previous link
   11
   const time = new Date() - operation.getContext().start;
   12
   console.log(`operation ${operation.operationName} took ${time} to
   complete`);
   13
   return data;
   14
   })
   15
   });
   16
   17
   const additiveLink = from([
   18
   timeStartLink,
   19
   logTimeLink
   20
   ]);
   (BUTTON) Copy

   This example defines two links, timeStartLink and logTimeLink. The
   timeStartLink assigns the current time to the context's start field.
   When the operation completes, the logTimeLink then subtracts the value
   of start from the current time to determine the total duration of the
   operation.

   You can set the context object's initial value for a particular
   operation by providing the context parameter to the useQuery hook (or
   useMutation, useSubscription, etc.).
