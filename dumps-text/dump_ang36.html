   In computer science, link time refers to the period of time, during the
   creation of a computer program, in which a linker is being applied to
   that program.^[1]^[2]^[3] Link time occurs after compile time and
   before runtime (when a program is executed).

   It is common to speak of link time operations (the operations performed
   by a linker) or link time requirements (programming language
   requirements that must be met by compiled source code for it to be
   successfully linked).

Link time operations[edit]

   The operations performed at link time usually include fixing up the
   addresses of externally referenced objects and functions, various kinds
   of cross module checks (e.g. type checks on externally visible
   identifiers and in some languages instantiation of templates). Some
   optimizing compilers delay code generation until link time because it
   is here that information about a complete program is available to them.
   Resolving external variables in a program is also done at link time.

   The link-time optimization (LTO), when enabled, occurs at link time.

Link time requirements[edit]

   The definition of a programming language may specify link time
   requirements that source code must meet to be successfully compiled
   (e.g. the maximum number of characters in an externally visible
   identifier that must be considered significant).

Exceptions[edit]

   In some programming languages^[which?] it may be necessary for some
   compilation and linking to occur at runtime.
