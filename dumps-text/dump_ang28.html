   Link is the main charectar Shigeru Miyamotoʼs classic series "Zelda".
   He was named link because Shiggy thought of him as the "Link" between
   the player and the game world. He is a Hylian, an elfish type charcetar
   from the land of hyrule. In most games, he is young (looks about 12,
   but he becomes an adult for Half of OOT), with golden-blond or brown
   hair, and wears a Green tunic. Except for OOT and MM, link is reborn in
   a diffrent time and storyline in every game (as is Princess Zelda)
   and prevents ganondorf, the evil wizard guy who was the only male born
   amoung the Geurdos, from stealing the triforce. The storylines do
   relate to each other tho (espically in Wind Waker)
   Link...he come to town...come to save...the princess zelda!

   The Legend of Zelda series (which is poorly named, considering that
   itʼs Link that does most of the legendary stuff) features Link as its
   main character. He is world renown for dressing like a flamboyant elf,
   swinging his big thing around (his sword, I mean), and never saying
   anything, even when heʼs being stoned to death by Octoroks.
   Ganon: Time to die, Link.
   Link: ...
   Ganon: Ugh, the silent treatment again!
