인간 관계 문제 (Relationship issues) [296]star_border Save this page

   암은 환자, 환자의 파트너 그리고 가족과 친구들에게 영향을 미칩니다. 이는 여러 면에서 인간 관계를 변화시킬 수 있습니다.

   사람들은 인간 관계를 관리하는 다양한 방법을 찾으며 필요한 경우 지원을 받을 수 있습니다.

파트너와의 관계

   암은 환자와 배우자의 관계에 많은 부담이 될 수 있습니다. 이 시기에는 두 사람 모두에게 혼란스럽고 스트레스가 되고 감정적이
   되기 쉽습니다. 일부 커플들은 이로 인해 더 가까워질 수도 있지만,  어떤 커플들은 갈등을 겪을 수도 있습니다.

   암에 대처하는 방법에 있어서 정답은 없습니다. 그러나 당신의 관계를 돕기 위해 당신 자신이 할 수 있는 일들이 있습니다.
     * 자신의 감정에 대해 그리고 암이 자신의 삶에 어떤 영향을 미쳤는지에 대해 파트너와 이야기를 나누어 봅니다.
     * 감정을 정리할 수 있도록 일기나 블로그에 자신의 감정을 적어 둡니다.
     * 파트너와 함께 하는 활동 및 외출 계획을 세워봅니다.
     * 파트너가 당신을 어떻게 지원할 수 있는지 이야기합니다.
     * 혼자서 또는 파트너와 함께 상담사에게 이야기합니다.
     * 비슷한 상황을 겪은 사람들과 이야기를 나누어 봅니다.
     * 지원과 조언을 위해 Cancer Council에 13 11 20로 전화를 합니다.

가족 및 친구와의 관계

   가족, 친구 및 직장 동료는 당신의 암에 대해 각기 다른 반응을 보일 것입니다.
     * 어떤 사람들은 슬퍼서 할 말을 잃고 어떤 사람들은 많은 질문을 할 것입니다.
     * 어떤 사람은 부적절한 말을 하여 당신을 불편하게 할 수도 있습니다. 그들은 대개 고의로 그렇게 하진 않지만 당신의 소식에
       많이 놀랄 수도 있습니다.
     * 어떤 사람들은 무슨 말을 해야 될지 몰라 당신을 피할 수도 있습니다. 이는 당신의 마음을 불편하게 하고 실망감이
       들게하거나 화가 나게 할 수도 있습니다.
     * 치료를 받는 동안, 어떤 사람들은 많은 지원을 제공할 것입니다. 이전에는 잘 몰랐던 사람들이 많은 도움을 줄 수도 있고,
       잘 알고 지내던 사람들과 더 멀어지는 경우도 있습니다

   당신이 느끼는 방식도 관계에 영향을 줄 수 있습니다.
     * 당신이 말하고 싶지 않을 때가 있을 수도 있으며 그래도 괜찮습니다. "물어봐 줘서 고맙지만 지금은 그것에 대해 이야기하고
       싶지 않아."라고 말할 수 있습니다.
     * 당신이 사람들과 의미있는 시간을 보내길 원하는 경우도 있을 것입니다.

   지원 그룹에 가입하고 비슷한 상황에 처한 다른 사람들과 대화를 나누는 것이 도움이 될 수도 있습니다. Cancer
   Council에서는 지원 그룹을 운영하고 전화 지원을 제공합니다.
