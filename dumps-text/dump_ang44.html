   Website linking style
   See also: Deeplink (company) and Mobile deep linking

   In the context of the World Wide Web, deep linking is the use of a
   hyperlink that links to a specific, generally searchable or indexed,
   piece of web content on a website (e.g.
   "https://example.com/path/page"), rather than the website's home page
   (e.g., "https://example.com"). The URL contains all the information
   needed to point to a particular item. Deep linking is different from
   mobile deep linking, which refers to directly linking to in-app content
   using a non-HTTP URI.

Deep linking and HTTP[edit]

   The technology behind the World Wide Web, the Hypertext Transfer
   Protocol (HTTP), does not actually make any distinction between "deep"
   links and any other links—all links are functionally equal. This is
   intentional; one of the design purposes of the Web is to allow authors
   to link to any published document on another site. The possibility of
   so-called "deep" linking is therefore built into the Web technology of
   HTTP and URLs by default—while a site can attempt to restrict deep
   links, to do so requires extra effort. According to the World Wide Web
   Consortium Technical Architecture Group, "any attempt to forbid the
   practice of deep linking is based on a misunderstanding of the
   technology, and threatens to undermine the functioning of the Web as a
   whole".^[1]

Usage[edit]

   Some commercial websites object to other sites making deep links into
   their content either because it bypasses advertising on their main
   pages, passes off their content as that of the linker or, like The Wall
   Street Journal, they charge users for permanently valid links.
   Sometimes, deep linking has led to legal action such as in the 1997
   case of Ticketmaster versus Microsoft, where Microsoft deep-linked to
   Ticketmaster's site from its Sidewalk service. This case was settled
   when Microsoft and Ticketmaster arranged a licensing agreement.
   Ticketmaster later filed a similar case against Tickets.com, and the
   judge in this case ruled that such linking was legal as long as it was
   clear to whom the linked pages belonged.^[2] The court also concluded
   that URLs themselves were not copyrightable, writing: "A URL is simply
   an address, open to the public, like the street address of a building,
   which, if known, can enable the user to reach the building. There is
   nothing sufficiently original to make the URL a copyrightable item,
   especially the way it is used. There appear to be no cases holding the
   URLs to be subject to copyright. On principle, they should not be."

Deep linking and web technologies[edit]

   Websites built on technologies such as Adobe Flash and AJAX often do
   not support deep linking. This can cause usability problems for
   visitors to those sites. For example, they may be unable to save
   bookmarks to individual pages or states of the site, use the web
   browser forward and back buttons—and clicking the browser refresh
   button may return the user to the initial page.

   However, this is not a fundamental limitation of these technologies.
   Well-known techniques, and libraries such as SWFAddress^[3] and unFocus
   History Keeper,^[4] now exist that website creators using Flash or AJAX
   can use to provide deep linking to pages within their
   sites.^[5]^[6]^[7]

Court rulings[edit]

   Probably the earliest legal case arising out of deep linking was the
   1996 Scottish case of The Shetland Times vs. The Shetland News, in
   which the Times accused the News of appropriating stories on the Times'
   website as its own.^[8]^[9]

   At the beginning of 2006, in a case between the search engine Bixee.com
   and job site Naukri.com, the Delhi High Court in India prohibited
   Bixee.com from deep linking to Naukri.com.^[10]

   The most important and widely cited U.S. opinions on deep linking are
   the Ninth Circuit's rulings in Kelly v. Arriba Soft Corp.^[11] and
   Perfect 10, Inc. v. Amazon.com, Inc..^[12] In both cases, the court
   exonerated the use of deep linking. In the second of these cases, the
   court explained (speaking of defendant Google, whom Perfect 10 had also
   sued) why linking is not a copyright infringement under US law:

     Google does not…display a copy of full-size infringing photographic
     images for purposes of the Copyright Act when Google frames in-line
     linked images that appear on a user's computer screen. Because
     Google's computers do not store the photographic images, Google does
     not have a copy of the images for purposes of the Copyright Act. In
     other words, Google does not have any "material objects…in which a
     work is fixed…and from which the work can be perceived, reproduced,
     or otherwise communicated" and thus cannot communicate a copy.
     Instead of communicating a copy of the image, Google provides HTML
     instructions that direct a user's browser to a website publisher's
     computer that stores the full-size photographic image. Providing
     these HTML instructions is not equivalent to showing a copy. First,
     the HTML instructions are lines of text, not a photographic image.
     Second, HTML instructions do not themselves cause infringing images
     to appear on the user's computer screen. The HTML merely gives the
     address of the image to the user's browser. The browser then
     interacts with the computer that stores the infringing image. It is
     this interaction that causes an infringing image to appear on the
     user's computer screen. Google may facilitate the user's access to
     infringing images. However, such assistance raised only contributory
     liability issues and does not constitute direct infringement of the
     copyright owner's display rights. …While in-line linking and framing
     may cause some computer users to believe they are viewing a single
     Google webpage, the Copyright Act, unlike the Trademark Act, does
     not protect a copyright holder against acts that cause consumer
     confusion.

   In December 2006, a Texas court ruled that linking by a motocross
   website to videos on a Texas-based motocross video production website
   did not constitute fair use. The court subsequently issued an
   injunction.^[13] This case, SFX Motor Sports Inc., v. Davis, was not
   published in official reports, but is available at 2006 WL 3616983.

   In a February 2006 ruling, the Danish Maritime and Commercial Court
   (Copenhagen) found systematic crawling, indexing and deep linking by
   portal site ofir.dk of real estate site Home.dk not to conflict with
   Danish law or the database directive of the European Union. The Court
   stated that search engines are desirable for the functioning of the
   Internet, and that, when publishing information on the Internet, one
   must assume—and accept—that search engines deep-link to individual
   pages of one's website.^[14]

Legend[edit]

   Web site owners who don't want search engines to deep link, or want
   them only to index specific pages can request so using the Robots
   Exclusion Standard (robots.txt file). People who favor deep linking
   often feel that content owners who don't provide a robots.txt file are
   implying by default that they do not object to deep linking either by
   search engines or others.^[citation needed] People against deep linking
   often claim that content owners may be unaware of the Robots Exclusion
   Standard or may not use robots.txt for other reasons.^[citation needed]
   Sites other than search engines can also deep link to content on other
   sites, so some question the relevance of the Robots Exclusion Standard
   to controversies about Deep Linking.^[15] The Robots Exclusion Standard
   does not programmatically enforce its directives so it does not prevent
   search engines and others who do not follow polite conventions from
   deep linking.^[16]
