The State Department LinkTree Alternative.

   Brought to you by GPA Mission Website Platforms, Digital Strategy &
   Training, and Digital Lab.
     __________________________________________________________________

   GPA Digital Lab (LAB) has designed and launched a new product for
   social media content strategy in collaboration with the Digital
   Strategy & Training team and Mission Website Platforms (MWP).

   Social Links was launched on April 1, 2021 and received valuable
   feedback during the initial 30-day pilot. We are happy to announce that
   Social Links is now available for all Missions to use!

What is Social Links?

   Social Links is a tool developed and owned by the Department of State
   that enables Department social media practitioners and content managers
   to provide their audiences with a secure way to view promoted content.
   Social Links enhances content strategy in a similar way as other
   popular tools on the market, such as Link in Bio or Linktree. The
   Social Links URL is placed in an Instagram account bio to drive traffic
   towards calls to action, downstream web properties and valuable content
   that your Mission wants to promote.

   LAB designed the first iteration of Social Links with Missions in mind
   by tailoring features to fit the specific needs of staff in the field
   based on real user feedback. It was designed as a plugin for WordPress
   and is already installed on the Mission Website Platform administrative
   site. It can be activated on your site by request and Social Link pages
   are hosted as part of your existing Mission website.

Why Use Social Links?

   Third-party platforms, like LinkTree, are not FedRAMP approved, which
   focuses on the security and protection of sensitive federal information
   within cloud technologies. By creating a State Department-owned version
   of these tools, Social Links is able provide valuable benefits specific
   to the Department’s unique needs. They include:
     * Security: Using a third-party platform that is not FedRAMP approved
       poses security risks to the Department. Since Social Links is
       installed on the Mission Website Platform, it inherits the security
       standards already in place on your current website.
     * Branding: Social Links provides cohesive branding through two style
       templates that match both the legacy Mission websites as well as
       the new redesigned sites launched this year.
     * Traffic: Using a third-party platform sends valuable traffic away
       from DOS web properties but because Social Links is hosted on your
       Mission website, all initial web traffic stays within DOS
       properties. Since Google Analytics is already in use for your
       Mission website, you have access to powerful analytics for Social
       Links as well.
     * Access: Mission staff can easily access and manage Social Links
       through your Mission website administration site.

     * Users that will need access to manage your Social Links page (Note:
       users that are not approved MWP users will need to complete an
       extra step requiring management approval to authorize site access;
       users must also have an america.gov account)

   To request additional users for existing posts, please refer to the
   following instructions document.

User Guides & Training

   To ensure you’ll benefit from all the features available in  Social
   Links, the LAB  developed a step-by-step user guide with screenshots

   hosted two training sessions for our pilot group, which are available
