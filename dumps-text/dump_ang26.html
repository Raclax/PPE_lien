   If you’ve created a Facebook page or Twitter account for your business,
   chances are, you would've already linked to your website within your
   profile.


   After all, you don’t just want your followers to simply check out your
   status updates and call it a day -- you want them to click through to
   your website, and hopefully convert into a paying user.


   What many business owners neglect, though, is linking to their social
   media profiles on their website.


   Why is it important to add social media links on your website, and how
   do you go about adding these links? In this article, we explore all
   that, and more.


   Quick aside: just so we’re clear, we’re talking about social media
   links, not social media share links or sharing buttons. If you want to
   learn more about utilizing social media share links to promote your
   content, we’ll be sharing an article about this in future.


What are Social Media Links?


   Social media links are clickable icons or buttons that can be displayed
   on your website that direct your visitors to your various social media
   accounts.


   These links typically appear as icons representing popular social media
   platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest,
   YouTube, and more.


   By integrating social media links on a website, you provide visitors
   with an easy and direct way to connect with you or your business on
   various social platforms.


Why are Social Media Links Important for Your Website?


   At the most basic level, adding social media links on your website
   helps you grow your followers. that aside, you’ll also be able to
   achieve other goals and objectives by featuring your social media
   accounts on your website. Read on to find out more!

1. Nurture Your Website Visitors Via Social Media Links

   Say you get 100 visitors who land on your website, every day.


   The average website conversion rate is a low, low 2.35%, so this means
   that approximately 2 of your visitors will convert as paying customers,
   and the other 98 will churn away into oblivion. Such a pity, huh?

   nurturing website visitors


   Now, adding social media links on your website is a great way to keep
   in touch with these consumers, and stay at the forefront of their
   consciousness.


   Assuming you have great content on your social media platforms, and
   your site visitors decide to follow you, you basically get a chance to
   nurture them through your content (both organic and paid).


   The goal is to achieve top-of-mind awareness, and convert them further
   down the road.


   At this point, you might be wondering: can’t I do the same with an
   email list? Yes, that’s true, but most consumers don’t sign up for a
   mailing list unless you’re dangling a carrot in front of them.


   If you’re a SaaS business, you might have to give away a free eBook or
   trial. If you’re in the eCommerce line, the standard practice is to
   offer a promo code when someone signs up for your mailing list.


   The bottom line? All things considered, there’s less friction
   associated with a consumer following a brand of Facebook, as opposed to
   signing up for their mailing list.


   You can still offer a newsletter sign-up, of course. But for your site
   visitors who aren’t comfortable with joining your list or parting with
   their email, take the conversation over to social media instead!

2. Build Trust and Demonstrate Authenticity

   In this day and age, authenticity is everything. 90% of millennials and
   85% of Gen X consumers say that authenticity plays a key role in
   influencing which brands they support; data has also shown that
   authentic brands tend to attract more “high-value” customers.


   sign be authentic


   While many companies do have an “Our Story” page that details their CSR
   initiatives or how they give back to society, you can go one step
   further and demonstrate authenticity via your social media posts.


   Here’s an example: if your brand’s selling point is that all your
   products are made in the USA, posting weekly #behindthescenes photos
   and videos (and encouraging your website visitors click through and
   view this content!) will make your story more convincing.


   At the end of the day, consumers are no longer looking for a
   well-polished brand that says all the right things.


   Instead, they want to put their money behind brands which are
   authentic, meaningful, and transparent.


   By guiding your site visitors off your corporate page, and to your
   social media profiles, you can connect with them in a more meaningful
   way, and show them who you truly are.

3. Improve Search Rankings

   Interestingly enough, adding social media links for websites may
   increase your website’s visibility on search engines.


   Google has previously stated that companies should link to their
   Google+ page on their website because it “provides Google with
   information (...) to help determine the relevancy of your site to a
   user query on Google Search.”


   graph improve search rankings social media


   Full disclaimer: we don’t have a ton of information on how this works.


   If you do a quick search, you’ll see that a good deal of the online
   discourse revolves around how Google+ is useful for promoting content
   that you post on the platform itself (NOT how it gives your website SEO
   juice).


   That said, it’s simple to add social media links on your website, so if
   there’s even a small chance that this can improve your search rankings,
   why not go for it?

Best Practices for Including Social Media Links on Your Website

1. Strategically Place the Icons

   Place the social media icons in a visible location so that visitors can
   easily spot and click on them to access your social profiles. The
   header, footer, or sidebar are all great options.

2. Use Recognizable Icons

   Use recognizable and standardized icons for popular social media
   platforms to ensure visitors can quickly identify and associate them
   with the respective platforms. Icons with the platform's official
   colors and designs are recommended.

3. Maintain Consistency

   Maintain a consistent style for your social media icons in terms of
   size, design, and spacing. Consistency across your website enhances the
   overall aesthetic and provides a cohesive user experience.

4. Opt for a Simple Design

   Keep the design of the social media icons simple and uncluttered. You
   want to avoid excessive animation or flashy effects that can distract
   visitors from the main content of your website.

5. Include Alt Text

   Add descriptive alt text to your social media icons for accessibility
   purposes. Alt text allows screen readers to describe the icon to users
   with visual impairments, improving the inclusivity of your website.

6. Open Links in a New Tab

   Configure the social media links to open in a new browser tab. This
   ensures that visitors can easily return to your website after visiting
   your social media profiles.

7. Link to Active Profiles

   Double-check that the social media links direct visitors to your
   current and active profiles.


   Outdated or inactive profiles can create a negative impression and
   diminish trust in your online presence. It also creates a bad user
   experience which affects the overall perception of your brand.

8. Utilize Hover Effects

   Incorporate subtle hover effects on the social media icons to show
   visitors that the icons are clickable.

9. Prioritize Relevant Platforms

   Feature the social media platforms that align with your target audience
   and business objectives.


   Highlighting the platforms where you are most active and engaged is
   also a great way to ensure that our target audience knows where to go
   for regular updates about your company.

10. Regularly Update Links

   Periodically review and update your social media links to ensure they
   remain current and relevant. It’s also important to add any new
   platforms you've joined and remove any obsolete ones.


In Conlusion


   Including social media links on your website is a fundamental step in
   building a robust online presence and expanding your reach to a broader
   audience.


   By implementing these best practices, you can seamlessly integrate
   social media icons into your website and encourage meaningful
   engagement with your audience across various platforms.
